CC BY 4.0. \nExecutive summary  \nElectric car sales break new records with momentum \nexpected to continue through 2023 \nElectric car markets are seeing exponential growth  as sales exceeded \n10 million in 2022. A total of 14% of all new cars sold were electric in 2022, up \nfrom around 9% in 2021 and less than 5% in 2020. Three markets dominate d \nglobal sales. China was the frontrunner once again, accounting for around 60% of \nglobal electric car sales. More than half of the electric cars on roads worldwide are \nnow in China and the country has already exceeded its 2025 target for new energy \nvehicle sales. In Europe, the second largest market, e lectric car sales increased \nby over 15% in 2022, meaning that more than one in every five cars sold was \nelectric. Electric car sales in the United States  \u2013 the third largest market \u2013 \nincreased 55% in 2022, reaching a sales share of 8%. \nElectric car sales are  expected to continue strongly through 2023. Over \n2.3 million electric cars were sold in the first quarter, about 25% more than in the \nsame period last year. We currently expect to see 14 million in sales by the end of \n2023, representing a 35% year-on-year increase with new purchases accelerating \nin the second half of this year. As  a result, electric cars could account for 18% of \ntotal car sales across the full calendar year. National policies and incentives will \nhelp bolster sales, while a return to the exceptionally high oil prices seen last year \ncould further motivate prospective buyers.  \nThere are promising signs for emerging electric vehicle (EV) markets, albeit \nfrom a small base. Electric car sales are generally low outside the major markets, \nbut 2022 was a growth year in India, Thailand and Indonesia.  Collectively, sales \nof electric cars in these countries more than tripled compared to 2021, reaching \n80 000. For Thailand, the share of electric cars in total sales came in at slightly \nover 3% in 2022, while both India and Indonesia averaged around 1.5% last year. \nIn India, EV and component manufacturing is ramping up,  supported by the \ngovernment\u2019s USD 3.2 billion incentive programme that has attracted investments \ntotalling USD 8.3 billion. Thailand and Indonesia are also str engthening their  \npolicy support schemes, potentially providing  valuable experience for other \nemerging market economies seeking to foster EV adoption.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Executive summary \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 9  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nLandmark EV policies are driving the outlook for EVs \ncloser to climate ambitions \nMarket trends and policy efforts in major car markets are supporting a bright \noutlook for EV sales. Under the IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), the \nglobal outlook for the share of electric car sales based on existing policies and firm \nobjectives has increased to 35% in 2030, up from less than 25% in the previous \noutlook. In the projections, China retains  its position as the largest market for \nelectric cars with 40% of total sales by 2030 in the STEPS. The United States \ndoubles its market share to 20% by the end of the decade as recent policy \nannouncements drive demand, while Europe maintains its current 25% share. \nProjected demand for electric cars in major car markets will have profound \nimplications on energy markets and climate goals in the current policy \nenvironment. Based on existing policies, oil demand from  road transport is \nprojected to peak around 2025 in the STEPS, with the amount of oil displaced by \nelectric vehicles exceeding 5 million barrels per day in 2030. In the STEPS, \nemissions of around 700 Mt CO2-equivalents are avoided by the use of electric \ncars in 2030. \nThe European Union and the United States have passed legislation to match \ntheir electrification ambitions. The European Union adopted new CO 2 \nstandards for cars and vans that are aligned with the 2030 goals set out in the Fit \nfor 55 package. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), combined \nwith adoption of California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars II rule by a number of states , \ncould deliver a 50% market share for electric cars in 2030, in line with the national \ntarget. The implementation of the recently proposed emissions standards from the \nUS Environmental Protection Agency is set to further increase this share.  \nBattery manufacturing continues to expand, encouraged by the outlook for \nEVs. As of March 2023, announcements on battery manufacturing capacity \ndelivered by  2030 are more than sufficient to meet the demand implied by \ngovernment pledges and would even be able to cover the demand for electric \nvehicles in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. It is therefore well possible \nthat higher shares of sales are achievable for electric cars than those anticipated \non the basis of current government policy and national targets. \nAs spending and competition increase, a growing \nnumber of more affordable models come to market \nGlobal spending on electric cars exceeded USD  425 billion in 2022, up 50% \nrelative to 2021. Only 10% of the spending can be attributed to government \nsupport, the remainder was from consumers . Investors  have also maintained \nconfidence in EVs, with  the stocks of EV -related companies consistently  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Executive summary \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 10  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \noutperforming traditional carmakers since 2019. Venture capital investments in \nstart-up firms developing EV and battery technologies have also boomed , \nreaching nearly USD 2.1 billion in 2022, up 30% relative to 2021, with investments \nincreasing in batteries and critical minerals. \nSUVs and large cars dominate available electric car options in 2022. They  \naccount for 60% of available BEV options in China and Europe and an even \ngreater share in the United States, similar to the trend towards SUVs seen in \ninternal combustion engine ( ICE) car markets. In 2022, ICE SUVs emitted  over \n1 Gt CO2, far greater than the 80 Mt net emissions reductions from the electric \nvehicle fleet that year. Battery electric SUVs often have batteries that are two- to \nthree-times larger than small cars, requiring more critical minerals. However, last \nyear e lectric SUVs resulted in the displacement of over 150 000 barrels of oil \nconsumption per day and avoided the associated tailpipe emissions that would \nhave been generated through burning the fuel in combustion engines.  \nThe electric car market is increasingly competitive. A growing number of new \nentrants, primarily from China but also from other emerging markets , are offering \nmore affordable models. Major incumbent carmakers are increasing ambition as \nwell, especially in Europe, and 2022-2023 saw another series of important EV \nannouncements: fully electric fleets, cheaper cars, greater investment, and vertical \nintegration with battery-making and critical minerals. \nConsumers can choose from an increasing number of options for electric \ncars. The number of available electric car models reached 500 in 2022, more than \ndouble the options available in 2018. However, outside of China, there is a need \nfor original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs) to offer affordable, competitively \npriced options in order to enable mass adoption of EVs. Today\u2019s level of available \nelectric car models is still significantly lower than the number of ICE options on the \nmarket, but the number of ICE models available has been steadily decreasing \nsince its peak in the mid-2010s.  \nFocus expands to electrification of more vehicle \nsegments as electric cars surge ahead \nElectrification of road transport goes beyond cars. Two or three-wheelers are \nthe most electrified market segment today ; in emerging markets and developing \neconomies, they outnumber cars. Over half of India\u2019s three- wheeler registrations \nin 2022 were electric, demonstrating their growing popularity due to government \nincentives and lower lifecycle costs compared with conventional models, \nespecially in the context of higher fuel prices.  In many developing economies, \ntwo/three-wheelers offer an affordable way to get access to mobility, meaning their \nelectrification is important to support sustainable development. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Executive summary \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 11  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nThe c ommercial vehicle stock is also seeing increasing electrification. \nElectric light commercial vehicle (LCV) sales worldwide increased by more than \n90% in 2022 to more than 310 000 vehicles, even as overall LCV sales declined \nby nearly 15% . In 2022, nearly 66 000 electric buses and 60 000 medium- and \nheavy-duty trucks were sold worldwide, representing about 4.5% of all bus sales \nand 1.2% of truck sales. Where governments have committed to reduce emissions \nfrom public transport, such as in dense urban areas, electric bus sales reached \neven higher shares; in Finland, for example, electric bus sales accounted for over \n65% in 2022.  \nAmbition with respect to electrifying heavy-duty vehicles is growing. In \n2022, around 220 electric heavy-duty vehicle models entered the market, bringing \nthe total to over 800 models offered by  well over 100 OEMs. A total of 27  \ngovernments have pledged to achieve 100% ZEV bus and truck sales by 2040  \nand b oth the United States and European Union have also proposed stronger \nemissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles.  \nEV supply chains and batteries gain greater prominence \nin policy-making \nThe increase in demand for electric vehicles is driving demand for batteries \nand related critical minerals. Automotive lithium -ion (Li -ion) battery demand \nincreased by about 65% to 550 GWh in 2022, from about 330 GWh in 2021, \nprimarily as a result of growth in electric passenger car sales. In 2022, about 60% \nof lithium, 30% of cobalt and 10% of nickel demand was for EV batteries. Only five \nyears prior, these shares were around 15%, 10% and 2%, respectively. Reducing \nthe need for critical materials will be important for supply chain sustainability, \nresilience and security, especially given recent price developments for  battery \nmaterial. \nNew alternatives to conventional lithium -ion are on the rise. The  share of  \nlithium-iron-phosphate ( LFP) chemistries reached its highest point ever , driven \nprimarily by China: around 95% of the LFP batteries for electric LDVs went into \nvehicles produced in China. Supply chains for (lithium-free) sodium-ion batteries \nare also being established, with over 100 GWh of manufacturing capacity either \ncurrently operating or announced, almost all in China. \nThe EV supply chain is expanding, but manufacturing remains \nhighly concentrated in certain regions, with China being the main player \nin battery and EV component trade. In 2022, 35% of exported electric cars \ncame from China, compared with 25% in 2021. Europe is China\u2019s largest \ntrade partner for both electric cars and their batteries. In 2022, the share of \nelectric cars manufactured in China and sold in the European mark\net increased \nto 16%, up from about 11% in 2021.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Executive summary \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 12  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nEV supply chains are increasingly at the f orefront of EV -related policy-\nmaking to build resilience through diversification. The Net Zero Industry Act, \nproposed by  the European Union i n March 2023, aims for nearly 90% of the \nEuropean Union\u2019s annual battery demand to be met by EU battery manufacturers, \nwith a manufacturing capacity of at least 550 GWh in 2030. Similarly, India aims \nto boost domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles and batteries through \nProduction Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes. In the United States, the Inflation \nReduction Act emphasises the strengthening of domestic supply chains for EVs , \nEV batteries and battery minerals, laid out in the criteria to qualify for clean vehicle \ntax credits. As a result, between August 2022 and March 2023, major EV and \nbattery makers announced cumulative post- IRA investments of at least \nUSD 52 billion in North American EV supply chains \u2013 of which 50% is for battery \nmanufacturing, and about 20% each for battery components and EV \nmanufacturing.  \n \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Electric Vehicles Initiative \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 13  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nElectric Vehicles Initiative \nThe Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI) is a multi -governmental policy forum \nestablished in 2010 under the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM). Recognising the \nopportunities offered by EVs, the EVI is dedicated to accelerating the adoption of \nEVs worldwide. To do so, it strives to better understand the policy challenges \nrelated to electric mobility, to help governments address them and to serve as a \nplatform for knowledge-sharing among government policy makers. The EVI also \nfacilitates exchanges between government policy makers and a variety of other \npartners on topics important for the transition to electric mobility, such as charging \ninfrastructure and grid integration as well as EV battery supply chains. In 2022, \nZero Emission Government Fleet Declaration was launched within the EVI, a \nstrong commitment among government to move towards 100% zero emission \nvehicles in public procurement. \nThe International Energy Agency serves as the co-ordinator  of the initiative. \nGovernments that have been active in the EVI in the 2022-23 period include \nCanada, Chile, People\u2019s Republic of China (hereafter \u201cChina\u201d), Finland, France, \nGermany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, \nSweden, United Kingdom and United States. Canada, China and the United \nStates are the co-leads of the initiative.  \nThe Global EV Outlook annual series is the flagship publication of the EVI. It is \ndedicated to track ing and monitoring the progress of electric mobility worldwide \nand to informing policy makers on how to best accelerate electrification of the road \ntransport sector. \n \n \n\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 14  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nTrends and developments in EV \nmarkets \nElectric light-duty vehicles \nElectric car sales continue to increase, led by China \nElectric car sales 1  saw another record year in 2022, despite supply chain \ndisruptions, macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainty , and high commodity \nand energy prices . The growth in electric car sales took place in the context of \nglobally contracting car markets : total car sales in 2022 dipped by 3% relative to \n2021. Electric car sales \u2013 including battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in \nhybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) \u2013 exceeded 10 million last year, up 55% relative \nto 2021.2 This figure \u2013 10 million EV sales worldwide \u2013 exceeds the total number \nof cars sold across the entire European Union ( about 9.5 million vehicles) and is \nnearly half of the total number of cars sold in China in 2022. I n the course of just \nfive years, from 2017 to 2022, EV sales jumped from around 1 million to more than \n10 million. It previously took five years from 2012 to 2017 for EV sales to grow \nfrom 100 000 to 1 million, underscoring the exponential nature of EV sales growth. \nThe share of electric cars in total car sales jumped from 9% in 2021 to 14% in \n2022, more than 10 times their share in 2017. \nOver 26 million electric cars were on the road in 2022, up \n60% relative to 2021 and more than 5 times the stock in \n2018 \nIncreasing sales pushed the total number of electric cars on the world\u2019s roads to \n26 million, up 60% relative to 2021, with BEVs accounting for over 70% of total \nannual growth, as in previous years. As a result, about 70% of the global stock of \nelectric cars in 2022 were BEVs. The increase in sales from 2021 to 2022 was just \nas high as from 2020 to 2021 in absolute terms \u2013  up 3.5 million \u2013 but relative \ngrowth was lower (sales doubled from 2020 to 2021). The exceptional boom in \n2021 may be explained by EV markets catching up in the wake of the coronavirus \n \n1 The term sales, as used in this report, represents an estimate of the number of new vehicles hitting the roads. Where \npossible, data on new vehicle registrations is used. In some cases, however, only data on retail sales (such as sales from a \ndealership) are available. See Box 1.2 for further details. The term car is used to represent passenger light-duty vehicles and \nincludes cars of different sizes, sports utility-vehicles and light trucks.  \n2 Unless otherwise specified, the term electric vehicle is used to refer to both battery electric and plug- in hybrid electric \nvehicles but does not include fuel cell electric vehicles. For a brief description of the trends related to fuel cell electric vehicles, \nsee Box 1.3. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 15  \nIEA.

Seen in comparison to recent years, the annual growth rate \nfor electric car sales in 2022 was similar to the average rate over 2015-2018, and \nthe annual growth rate for the global stock of electric cars in 2022 was similar to \nthat of 2021 and over the 2015-2018 period, s howing a robust recovery of EV \nmarket expansion to pre-pandemic pace. \nFigure 1.1 Global electric car stock in selected regions, 2010-2022 \n \nIEA.

In \u201cEurope\u201d, European Union countries, Norway, and the United Kingdom account for over \n95% of the EV stock in 2022; the total also includes Iceland, Israel, Switzerland and T\u00fcrkiye. Main markets in \u201cOther\u201d \ninclude Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Africa, Korea and \nThailand. \nThe statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli authorities.

In 2022, \nBEV sales in China increased by 60% relative to 2021 to reach 4.4 million, and \nPHEV sales nearly tripled to 1.5 million. The faster growth in PHEV sales relative \nto BEVs warrants further examination in the coming years, as PHEV sales still \nremain lower overall  and could be catching up on the post-Covid -19 boom only \nnow; BEV sales in China tripled from 2020 to 2021 after moderate growth over \n2018-2020.

For \nthe first time in 2022, China accounted for more than 50% of all the electric cars \non the world\u2019s roads, a total of 13.8 million. This strong growth results from more \nthan a decade of sustained policy support for early  adopters, including an \nextension of purchase incentives i nitially planned for phase-out in 2020 to the end \nof 2022 due to Covid-19, in addition to non-financial support such as rapid roll-out \nof charging infrastructure and stringent registration policies for non-electric cars. \nIn 2022, the share of electric cars in total domestic car sales reached 29%  in \nChina, up from 16% in 2021 and under 6% between 2018 and 2020. China has \ntherefore achieved i ts 2025 national target of a 20% sales share for so-called new \nenergy vehicles (NEVs )3 well in advance. All indicators point to further growth: \nalthough the national NEV sales target is yet to be updated by China\u2019s Ministry of \nIndustry and Information Technology (MIIT) , which is responsible for the \nautomotive industry, the objective of greater road transport electrification is re-\naffirmed in multiple strategy documents. China aims to reach a 50%  s ales share \nby 2030 in so-called \u201ckey air pollution control regions\u201d, and 40% ac ross the country  \nby 2030 to support the national action plan for carbon peaking. If recent market \ntrends continue, China\u2019s 2030 targets may also be reached ahead of time. \nProvincial governments are also supporting adoption of NEVs, with 18 provinces \nto date having set NEV targets.  \nSupport at the regional level in China has a lso helped to advance some of the \nworld\u2019s largest EV makers. Shenzhen-based BYD has supplied most of the city\u2019s \nelectric buses and taxis, and its leading position is also reflected in Shenzhen\u2019s \nambition of reaching a 60% N EV sales share by 2025. Guangzhou, which has a \n50% NEV sales share by 2025 target, facilitated the expansion of Xpeng Motors \nto become one of the national EV frontrunners.  \n3 NEVs (China) include BEVs, PHEVs and fuel cell electric vehicles.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 17  \nIEA.

Sales in January \n2023 plunged, and while this is in part due to the timing of the Chinese New Year, \nthey were nearly 10% lower than sales in January 2022. However, electric car \nsales caught up in February and March 2023, standing nearly 60% above sales in \nFebruary 2022 and more than 25% above sales in March 2022, thereby  bringing \nsales in the first quarter of 2023 more than 20% higher than in the first quarter of \n2022. \nGrowth remained steady in Europe despite disruptions \nIn Europe,4 electric car sales increased by more than 15% in 2022 relative to 2021 \nto reach 2.7  million. Sales grew more quickly in previous years: annual growth \nstood at more than 65% in 2021 and averaged 40% over 2017-2019. In 2022, BEV \nsales rose by 30%  relative to 2021 (compared to 65% growth in 2021 relative to \n2020) while PHEV sales dipped by around 3 %. Europe accounted for 10% of \nglobal growth in new electric car sales.

CC BY 4.0. \nsales are still increasing in Europe in the context of continued contraction in car \nmarkets: total car sales in Europe dipped by 3% in 2022 relative to 2021. \nThe slowdown seen in Europe relative to previous years was, in part, a reflection \nof the exceptional growth in electric car sales that took place in 2020 and 2021 in \nthe European Union, as manufacturers quickly adjusted corporate strategy to \ncomply with the CO2 emission standards passed in 2019. These standards \ncovered the 2020-2024 period, with EU -wide emission targets becoming stricter \nonly from 2025 and 2030 onwards.  \nHigh energy prices in 2022 had a mixed impact on the competitiveness of EVs \nrelative to internal combustion engine ( ICE) cars. Gasoline and diesel prices for \nICE cars spiked, but residential electricity tariffs (with relevance for charging) also \nincreased in some cases . Higher electricity and gas prices also increased \nmanufacturing costs for both ICE and EV cars, with some carmakers arguing that \nhigh energy prices could restrict future investment for new battery manufacturing \ncapacity. \nEurope remained the world\u2019s second largest market for electric cars after China in \n2022, accounting for 25% of all electric car sales and 30% of the global stock. The \nsales share of electric cars reached 21%, up from 18% in 2021, 10% in 2020 and \nunder 3% prior to 2019. European countries continued to rank highly for the sales \nshare of electric cars, led by Norway at 88%, Sweden at 54%, the Netherlands at \n35%, Germany at 31%, the United Kingdom at 23% and France at 21%  in 2022. \nIn volume terms, Germany is the biggest market in Europe with sales of 830 000 \nin 2022, followed by the United Kingdom with 370 000 and France with 330 000. \nSales also exceeded 80 000 in Spain. The share of electric cars in total car sales \nhas increased tenfold in Germany since before the Covid-19 pandemic, which can \nin part be explained by increasing support post-pandemic , such as purchase \nincentives through the Umweltbonus, and a frontloading of sales in 2022 in \nexpectation of subsidies being further reduced from 2023 onwards. However, in \nItaly, electric car sales decreased from 140 000 in 2021 to 115 000 in 2022, and \nthey also decreased or stagnated in Austria, Denmark and Finland. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 19  \nIEA.

In the first two months of 2023, battery  electric car sales were \nalready up by over 30% year-on-year, while overall car sales increased by just \nover 10% year-on-year. \nThe United States confirms return to growth \nIn the United States, electric car sales increased 55% in 2022 relative to 2021, led \nby BEVs. Sales of BEVs increased by 70%, reaching nearly 800 000 and \nconfirming a second consecutive year of strong growth after the 2019-2020 dip. \nSales of PHEVs also grew, albeit by only 15%. The increase in electric car sales \nwas particularly high in the United States, considering that total car sales dropped \nby 8% in 2022 relative to 2021, a much sharper decrease than the global average \n(minus 3%). Overall, the United States accounted for 10% of the global growth in \nsales. The total stock of electric cars reached 3  million, up 40% relative to 2021 \nand accounting for 10% of the global total. The share of electric cars in total car \nsales reached nearly 8%, up from just above 5% in 2021 and around 2% between \n2018 and 2020. \nA number of factors are helping to increase sales in the United States. A greater \nnumber of available models, beyond those offered by Tesla, the historic leader , \nhelped to close the supply  gap. Given that major companies like Tesla and \nGeneral Motors had already reached their subsidy cap under US support in \nprevious years,5 new models from other companies being available means  that \nmore consumers can benefit from purchase incentives, which can be as high as \nUSD 7 500. Awareness is increasing as government and companies lean towards \nelectrification: in 2022, a quarter of Americans expect that their next car will be \nelectric, according to the American Automobile Association. Although c harging \ninfrastructure and driving range have improved over the years, they remain major \nconcerns for US drivers given the typically long travel distances and lower \npopularity and limited availability of alternatives such as rail. However, in 2021 the \nBipartisan Infrastructure Law strengthened support for EV charging, allocating \nUSD 5 billion in total funding over the 2022-2026 period through the National \nElectric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, as well as USD  2.5 billion in \ncompetitive grants over the same period through the Charging and Fueling \nInfrastructure Discretionary Grant Program. \n \n5 Manufacturer caps were still in place  for sales taking place in 2022, with models by carmakers having sold over 200 000 \nEVs losing eligibility for the purchase incentive, even if they were manufactured in North America following requirements \nunder the IRA. Caps were removed starting from 2023. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 21  \nIEA.

The \nInflation Reduction Act (IRA) has triggered a rush by global electromobility \ncompanies to ex pand US manufacturing operations. Between August 2022 and \nMarch 2023, major EV and battery  makers announced cumulative post-IRA \ninvestments of USD 52 billion in North American EV supply chains, of which 50% \nis for battery manufacturing, and about 20% each for battery components and EV \nmanufacturing. Overall, company announcements  including tentative \ncommitments for US investments for future battery and EV production add up to \naround USD 75-108 billion. As an example, Tesla plans to relocate its Berlin -\nbased lithium-ion battery gigafactory to Texas , where it will work in partnership \nwith China\u2019s CATL, and to manufacture next-generation EVs in Mexico. Ford also \nannounced a deal with CATL for a battery plant in Michigan, and plans to increase \nelectric car manufacturing sixfold by the end of 2023 relative to 2022, at 600 000 \nvehicles per year, scaling up to 2 million by 2026. BMW is seeking to expand EV \nmanufacturing at its plant in South Carolina following the IRA. Volkswagen chose \nCanada for its first battery plant outside Europe , which will begin operations in \n2027, and is also investing USD 2 billion in its plant in South Carolina. While these \ninvestments can be expected to lead to high growth in the years to come, the \nimpact may only fully be seen from 2024 onwards as plants come online.  \n\u200b\n97%\n68%\n42%\n62%\n38%\n19%\n47%\n50%\n34%69%65%\n45%\n112%\n76%\n22%\n0\n 25\n 50\n 75\n 100\n 125\nOct\nNov\nDec\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nJan\nFeb\nMar\n2020 2021 2022 2023\nThousand\nBEV PHEV\nIRA\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 22  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nIn the immediate term, the IRA has constrained eligibility requirements for \npurchase incentives, as vehicles need to be produced in North America in order  \nto qualify for a subsidy. However, electric car sales have remained strong since \nAugust 2022 (Figure 1.4), and the first months of 2023 have been no exception: \nIn the first quarter of 2023, electric car sales increased 60% compared to the same \nperiod in 2022, potentially boosted by the January 2023 removal of the subsidy \ncaps for manufacturers, which means models by market leaders can now benefit \nfrom purchase incentives . In the longer-term, the list of models  eligible for \nsubsidies is expected to expand.  \nBox 1.1 The 2023 outlook for electric cars is bright \nEarly indications from first quarter sales of 2023 point to an upbeat market, \nsupported by cost declines as well as strengthened policy support in key markets \nsuch as the United States. Globally, our current estimate is therefore for nearly \n14 million electric cars to be sold in 2023, building on the more than 2.3 million \nalready sold in the first quarter of the year. This represents a 35% increase in \nelectric car sales in 2023 compared to 2022 and would bring the global electric sales \nshare to around 18%, up from 14% in 2022.  \nElectric car sales, 2010-2023 \n \nIEA.

In the United States, more than \n320 000 electric cars were sold in the first quarter of 2023, 60% more than over the \nsame period in 2022. Our current expectation is for this growth to be sustained \nthroughout the year, with electric car sales reaching over 1.5 million in 2023, \nbringing the electric car sales share in the United States up to around 12% in 2023. \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023E\nMillion\nChina Europe United States Other\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 23  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nIn China, electric car sales were off to a rough start in 2023, with January sales \nbeing 8% lower than in January 2022. The latest available data suggests a quick \nrecovery: over the entire first quarter of 2023, electric car sales in China were more \nthan 20% higher than in the first quarter of 2022, with more than 1.3 million electric \ncars being registered. For the remainder of 2023, we expect the generally \nfavourable cost structure of electric cars to outweigh the effects of the phase-out of \nthe NEV subsidy. As a result, our current expectation is for electric car sales  in \nChina to be more than 30% higher than in 2022 and reach around 8 million by the \nend of 2023, reaching a sales share of over 35% (from 29% in 2022). \nBased on recent trends and tightening CO2 targets not going into effect until 2025, \nthe growth of electric car sales in Europe is expected to be the lowest of the three \nlargest markets. In the first quarter of 2023, electric car sales in Europe increased \nby around 10% compared to the same period in 2022. For the full year, we currently \nexpect electric car sales to increase by over 25%, with one-in -four cars sold in \nEurope being electric.  \nOutside of the major EV markets, electric car sales are expected to reach around \n900 000 in 2023 \u2013 50% higher than in 2022. Electric car sales in India in the first \nquarter of 2023 are already double what they were in the same period in 2022. In \nIndia and across all regions outside the three major EV markets, electric car sales \nare expected to represent 2-3% of car sales in 2023, a relatively small yet growing \nshare. \nThere are, of course, downside risks to the 2023 outlook: a sluggish global economy \nand the phase-out of subsidies for NEVs in China could reduce 2023 growth in \nglobal electric car sales. On the upside, new markets may open up more quickly \nthan anticipated, as persistent high oil prices make the case for EVs stronger in an \nincreasing number of settings. And new policy developments, such as the April 2023 \nproposal from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to strengthen GHG \nemissions standards for cars, may send signals that boost sales even before going \ninto effect.  \nThe number of electric car models rises, especially for \nlarge cars and SUVs, at the same time as it decreases for \nconventional cars \nThe race to electrification is increasing the number of electric car models available \non the market. In 2022, the number of available options reached 500, up from \nbelow 450 in 2021 and more than doubling relative to 2018- 2019. As in previous \nyears, China has the broadest portfolio with nearly 300 available models, double \nthe number available in 2018-2019, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. This remains \nnearly twice as many as in Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, France \nand the United Kingdom, which all have around 150 models available, more than \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 24  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nthree times as many as before the pandemic. In the United States, there were \nfewer than 100 models available in 2022, but twice as many as before the \npandemic; and 30 or fewer were available in Canada, Japan and Korea. \nFigure 1.5 Car model availability by powertrain, 2010-2022 (left), and breakdown of \navailable cars by powertrain and segment in 2022 (right) \nIEA.

Large cars and SUVs still account for over half of available BEVs. \nThe 2022 trend reflects the increasing maturity of EV markets and demonstrates \nthat carmakers are responding to increasing consumer demand for electric cars . \nHowever, the number of electric car models available remains much lower than \nthat of conventional ICE cars, which has remained above 1 250 since 2010 and \npeaked at 1 500 in the middle of the past decade. In recent years, the number of \nICE models sold has been steadily decreasing, at a c ompound annual growth rate \nof minus 2% over the 2016-2022 period, reaching about 1 300 models in 2022. \nThis dip varies across major car markets and is most pronounced in China, where \nthe number of available ICE options was 8% lower in 2022 than in 2016, versus \n3-4% lower in the United States and Europe over the same period. This coul d\nr\nesult from contracting car markets and a progressive shift towards EVs among \nmajor carmakers. Looking forward, the total number of ICE models available could \nremain stable, while the number of new models sh rinks, if carmakers focus on \nelectrification and keep selling existing ICE options rather than increasing budgets \nto develop new models. \n0\n 250\n 500\n 750\n1 000\n1 250\n1 500\n1 750\n2010 2013 2016 2019 2022\nAvailable models\nGlobal availability over time\nBEV PHEV ICE\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nWorld China Europe USA World\nBEV types in 2022\nSmall car Medium car Crossover\nLarge car SUV\nICE\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 25  \nIEA.

Such growth is \nto be expected in a nascent market with a large number of new entrants bringing \ninnovative products to the market, and as incumbents diversify their portfolios . \nGrowth has been slightly lower in recent years: the annual growth rate stood at \naround 25% in 2021 and 15% in 2022. In the future, the number of models can be \nexpected to continue to  increase quickly, as major carmakers expand their EV \nportfolios and new entrants strengthen their positions,  particularly in emerging \nmarkets and developing economies (EMDEs). The historic number of ICE models \navailable on the market suggests that the current number of EV options could \ndouble, at least, before stabilising. \nFigure 1.6 Electric car model availability in selected countries by size, 2018-2022 \n \nIEA.

The number of large models is increasing more quickly than that of small models. \nSUVs and large car models dominate both EV and ICE markets  \nA major concern for global car markets \u2013 both EV and ICE \u2013 is the overwhelming \ndominance of SUVs and large models among available options. Carmakers are \nable to generate higher revenues from such models, given higher profit margins, \nwhich can cover some of the investments made in developing electric options . In \ncertain cases, such as in the United States, larger vehicles can also benefit from \nless stringent fuel economy standards, hence creating an incentive for carmakers \nto slightly increase the vehicle size of a car for it to qualify as a light truck. \nHowever, large models are more expensive, which poses significant affordability \nissues across the board, and all the more so in EMDEs.

In 2022, the sales -weighted average \nbattery size of small battery electric cars ranged from 25 kWh in China to 35 kWh \nacross France, Germany and the United Kingdom, and about 60 kWh in the \nUnited States. In comparison, the average for battery electric  SUVs was around \n70-75 kWh in these countries, and within the 75-90 kWh range for large car \nmodels.  \nTransitioning from ICE to electric is a priority for  achieving net zero emissions  \ntargets, regardless of vehicle size, but mitigating the impacts of higher battery \nsizes will also be important. In France, Germany and the United Kingdom in 2022, \nthe sales-weighted average weight of a battery electric SUV was 1.5 times higher \nthan the average small battery electric car , requiring greater amounts of steel, \naluminium and plastic; the battery in the SUV was twice as large, requiring about \n75% more critical minerals . The CO 2 emissions associated with materials \nprocessing, manufacturing and assembly can be estimated at more than 70%  \nhigher as a result. \nAt the same time, in 2022, electric SUVs resulted in the displacement of over \n150 000 barrels per day of oil consumption and avoided the associated tailpipe \nemissions that would have been generated through burning the fuel in combustion \nengines. Although electric SUVs represented roughly 35% of all electric \npassenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) in 2022, their share of oil displacement was \neven higher (about 40%), as SUVs tend to be driven more than smaller cars . Of \ncourse, smaller vehicles  generally require less energy to operate and less \nmaterials to build, but electric SUVs certainly remain favourable to ICE vehicles. \nIn 2022, ICE SUVs emitted  more than 1 Gt CO2, far greater than the 80 Mt net \nemissions reductions from the electric vehicle fleet that year. While total car sales \ndecreased by 0.5%  in 2022, SUV sales increased by 3% relative to 2021, \naccounting for about 45% of total car sales, with noticeable growth in the \nUnited States, India and Europe. Of the 1 300 available options for ICE cars in \n2022, more than 40% were SUVs, compared to fewer  than 35% for small  and \nmedium cars. The total number of available ICE options went down from 2016 to \n2022, but the drop was only for small and medium cars (down 35%) while large \ncars and SUVs increased (up 10%). \nSimilar trends are observed in EV markets. Around 16% of all SUVs sold were \nelectric in 2022, which is above the overall market share of EVs and demonstrates \nconsumer preferences for SUVs regardless of whether they are an ICE vehicle or \nEV. Nearly 40% of all BEV models available in 2022 were SUVs, which is \nequivalent to the shares of small and medium car options combined. Other large \nmodels accounted for more than 15%. Just 3 years before, in 2019, small and \nmedium models accounted for 60% of all available models, and SUVs just 30%.  \nIn China and Europe, SUVs and large models accounted for 60% of available BEV \noptions in 2022, on par with the world average. As a comparison, ICE SUVs and \nlarge models accounted for about 70% of available ICE options in these regions, \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 27  \nIEA.

Announcements by some major European carmakers indicate that \nthere could be a greater  focus on smaller, more popular models  in the years to \ncome. For example, Volkswagen has announced the launch of a compact model \nfor the European market under EUR 25 000 by 2025 and under EUR 20 000 by \n2026-2027, as a means to appeal to a broader consumer bas e. In the \nUnited States, over 80% of available BEV options in 2022 were SUVs or large car \nmodels, which is greater than the share of ICE SUVs or large models at 70%. \nLooking ahead , more electric SUVs are to be expected in the United States, \nshould recent policy announcements on expansion of IRA incentives to more \nSUVs be implemented. Following the IRA, the US Treasury has been revising \nvehicle classifications, and in 2023 changed the eligibility criteria for clean vehicle \ncredits relevant to smaller SUVs, which are now eligible if priced under \nUSD 80 000, up from the previous limit of USD 55 000. \nElectric cars remain much cheaper in China \nThe growth in electric car sales in China has been underpinned by sustained policy \nsupport, but also cheaper retail prices. In 2022, the sales-weighted average price \nof a small BEV in China was below USD 10 000. This is significantly less than the \nprices of small BEVs found in Europe and the United States, where the sales -\nweighted average price exceeded USD 30 000 in the same year.  \nFigure 1.7 Sales-weighted average retail price (left) and driving range (right) of BEV \npassenger cars in selected countries, by size, in 2022 \n \nIEA.

Together, these two models accounted for nearly 15% of Chinese \nBEV passenger car sales, illustrating the appetite for smaller models. To compare, \nthe best-selling small BEVs across France, Germany and the United Kingdom \u2013 \nFiat\u2019s 500, Peugeot\u2019s e-208 and Renault\u2019s Zoe \u2013 were all priced above \nUSD 35 000. Few small BEVs were sold i n the United States, limited mainly to \nChevrolet\u2019s Bolt and the Mini Cooper BEV, which are priced around USD 30 000. \nTesla\u2019s Y Model was the best-selling BEV passenger car in both the selected \nEuropean countries ( priced at more than USD 65 000) and the United States \n(more than USD 50 000).6 \nChinese carmakers have focused on developing smaller and more affordable \nmodels in advance of their international peers, cutting down costs following years \nof tough competition domestically. H undreds of small EV manufacturers have \nentered the market since the 2000s , benefitting from a variety of public support \nschemes, including subsidies and incentives for both consumers and \nmanufacturers. The majority  of these firms went bankrupt due to competition as \nsubsidies were gradually phased out, and the market has since consolidated \naround a dozen frontrunners, which have succeeded in developing small and \ncheap electric cars for the Chinese market. Vertical integration of battery and EV \nsupply chains from mineral processing to battery and EV manufacturing, as well \nas cheaper labour, manufacturing and access to finance across the board, have  \nalso contributed to developing cheaper models. \nMeanwhile, carmakers in Europe and the United States \u2013 both early developers \nsuch as Tesla and incumbent major  manufacturers \u2013 have mostly focused on \nlarger or more luxurious models to date, hence offering few options affordable for \nmass-market consumers. However, the small options available in these countries \ntypically offer greater performance than those in China, such as longer driving \nrange. In 2022, the sales -weighted average range of small BEVs sold in the \nUnited States was nearly 350 km, while in France, Germany and the \nUnited Kingdom it was just under 300 km, compared to under 220 km in China. \nFor other segments, the differences are less significant.  The broader availability \nof public charging points in China may, in part, explain why consumers there have \nbeen more willing to opt for lower driving ranges than their European or American \ncounterparts.  \nIn 2022, Tesla heavily reduced the price of its models on two occasions  as \ncompetition increase d, and many carmakers have also announced cheaper \noptions in the coming years. While these announcements warrant further \nexamination, this trend could indicate that the price gap between small electric \ncars and incumbent ICE options could progressively close during this decade. \n \n6 However, Tesla has decreased car prices several times since the publication of the IRA in the United States, in part to boost \nsales as competition gets tougher (see section on corporate strategy and finance). \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 29  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nEmerging markets see encouraging growth  \nChina, Europe and the United States \u2013 the three major markets for electric cars \u2013 \naccounted for about 95% of global sales in 2022. Emerging market and developing \neconomies (EMDEs) outside China account for only a fraction of the global electric \ncar market. Demand for electric cars has increased in recent years, but sales remain \nlow. \nWhile EMDEs often quickly adopt low -cost emerging technology products \n(e.g. smartphones, computers and connected devices), electric cars remain \ntypically too expensive for the majority of the population. According to a recent \nsurvey, ov er 50% of Ghanaian respondents would prefer to purchase an EV to an \nICE vehicle, but more than half of those potential consumers would not be willing to \nspend more than USD  20 000 for an electric car. Lack of a ccess to reliable and \naffordable charging can be a barrier, as can  limited access to EV servicing, \nmaintenance and repair. In most EMDEs, road transport remains largely based on \nsmaller mobility solutions in urban centres, such as two- and three-wheelers, which \nhave seen much greater success  in terms of electrification, as well as  shared \nmobility for regional commutes. Purchasing behaviour is also different, with lower \npersonal car ownership rates and more common purchase of used cars. Looking \nforward, while sales of electric cars \u2013 both new and used \u2013 can be expected to \nincrease in EMDEs, it is likely that many countries will continue to rely primarily on \ntwo- and three-wheelers (see subsequent section on these vehicles in this report). \nThere was a notable boom in electromobility in 2022 in India, Thailand and \nIndonesia. Collectively, sales of electric cars in these countries more than tripled \nrelative to 2021, reaching nearly 80 000. Sales in 2022 were 7 times higher than in \n2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic. In contrast, sales in other EMDEs were lower. \nIn India, BEV sales reached nearly 50 000 in 2022, 4 times more than in 2021, while \ntotal car sales increased by just below 15%. Leading domestic manufacturer Tata \naccounted for over 85% of BEV sales, including through sales of its small BEV \nTigor/Tiago, which quadrupled. Indian PHEV sales remained close to zero.  \nBurgeoning electromobility companies are  now betting on the government\u2019s \nProduction Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme \u2013 with around USD 2 billion in subsidy \nprogrammes \u2013 to ramp up EV and component manufacturing. This scheme has \nattracted investments totalling USD 8.3 billion.  \nThe Indian market, however, currently remains geared towards shared and smaller \nmobility. In 2022, 25% of electric car purchases in India were by fleet operators , \nsuch as for taxis . In early 2023, Tata secured  a large order from Uber for  \n25 000 electric cars. Furthermore, while 55% of three-wheelers sold were electric, \nfewer than 2% of cars sold were EVs. Ola, India\u2019s top EV company by revenue, \ndoes not yet offer electric cars. Ola is instead concentrating on smaller mobility and \naims to double its electric two- wheeler manufacturing capacity to 2 million by the \nend of 2023, and to reach an annual production capacity of 10 million between 2025 \nand 2028. The company also seeks to build lithium -ion battery manufacturing \nfacilities, initially at 5 GWh capacity, scaling up to 100 GWh by 2030. Ola aims to \nstart marketing electric cars for its taxi business by 2024 and to make its fleet of \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 30  \nIEA.

CC BY 4.0. \nIn Thailand, electric car sales doubled to 21 000, equally distributed between \nBEVs and PHEVs. The emerging presence of Chinese carmakers has accelerated \nEV adoption in the country. In 2021, Chinese original equipment manufacturer \n(OEM) Great Wall Motors  launched its Ora Good Cat BEV model in the Thai \nmarket, and in 2022 it became the most sold electric car in Thailand, with nearly \n4 000 sales. The second and third best-selling cars were also Chinese, \nmanufactured by Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) , none of \nwhich were sold in the country in 2020. Chinese automakers were able to undercut \nEV prices from foreign competitors also present in the Thai market, such as BMW \nand Mercedes, thereby appealing to a broader consumer base. In addition, the \nThai government offers various financial incentives for electric cars, including \nsubsidies, excise duty waivers and import tax reductions, which have contributed \nto making electric cars more attractive. Tesla is planning to enter the Thai market \nin 2023 along with building Superchargers. \nIn Indonesia, BEV sales multiplied by more than 14 , exceeding 10 000, while \nPHEV sales remained close to zero . In March 2023, Indonesia announced new \nincentives to  support sales of electric two-wheelers, cars and buses, with the aim \nof strengthening domestic capacity in EV and battery manufacturing through local \ncomponent requirements. The government aims to subsidise the sale of 200 000 \nelectric two-wheelers and 36 000 electric cars in 2023, reaching a sales share of \n4% and 5% respectively. The new subsidies could reduce the price of an electric \ntwo-wheeler by 25-50% to help compete against ICE equivalents. Indonesia plays \nan important role in EV and battery supply chains, in particular given its abundant \nraw mineral resources  and status as the world\u2019s largest nickel miner . This has \nattracted investment from global companies, and Indonesia could become the \nlargest manufacturing hub in the region for batteries and components. \nModel availability remains an issue in EMDEs, with many of the options  on sale \nheavily geared towards the higher  end, such as SUVs, large and luxur y models. \nWhile the trend for SUVs is global, purchasing power is more limited in EMDEs , \nmaking such vehicles largely unaffordable. Across the different regions \nconsidered in this section of the report, for a total of more than 60 EMDEs , \nincluding those which receive support from  the Global Environment Facility\u2019s \n(GEF) Global E-Mobility Programme, there were two to six  times more large \nmodels available than small ones in 2022.  \nIn Africa, the best-selling electric car model in 2022 was the Hyundai Kona, a \ncrossover BEV, and there were about as many recorded sales of Porsche\u2019s large \nand expensive Taycan BEV  as there were of Nissan\u2019s medium -sized Leaf BEV. \nThere were also eight times more sales of electric SUVs than of the Mini Cooper \nSE BEV and Renault Zoe BEV combined, the two best-selling small electric cars. \nIn India, the best-selling electric car model was Tata\u2019s crossover Nexon BEV, with \nover 32 000 sales, or three times more than the second best-selling model, Tata\u2019s \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 32  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nsmall Tigor/Tiago BEV. Across all of the EMDEs considered here, sales of electric \nSUVs reached 45 000, which is more than the sales of small (23 000) and medium \n(16 000) electric cars combined. In Costa Rica, the leading country in Latin \nAmerica in terms of BEV sales share, only 4 models in the top 20 were not SUVs, \nand nearly a third were luxury models. The future of mass-market electrification in \nEMDEs relies on the development of smaller, more affordable electric cars, \nalongside two- and three-wheelers.  \nBox 1.2 On the distinction between vehicle registrations and vehicle \nsales  \nAn important distinction for assessing the evolution of vehicle markets  is the \ndifference between registrations and sales. New registrations represent the number \nof vehicles that have been officially registered for the first time with the relevant \ngovernment ministry or insurance agency, including domestically produced and \nimported vehicles. Sales can either refer to vehicles sold by dealers or agencies \n(retail sales) , or to vehicles sold to dealers by vehicle manufacturers (factory \nshipments, i.e. including  exports). The choice of metric can make a significant \ndifference when analysing vehicle markets. For consistency in accounting across \nall countries, and to avoid double-counting at a global level, in this report vehicle \nmarket sizes are based on new vehicle registrations, where available, and retail \nsales otherwise, not on factory shipments. \nChina\u2019s vehicle market trends in 2022 are a good illustration of why this matters. In \n2022, an increase of 7 to 10% in factory shipments  (reported as sales) for the \nChinese passenger car market was reported, while insurance registrations showed \na stagnation of the domestic market in the same year. This increase was observed \nin data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), which is \nthe official data source for China\u2019s car industry. CAAM data is collected from car \nmanufacturers and represents factory shipments. Another widely referenced source \nis the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), a non-governmental organisation \nthat provides wholesale, retail sales and exports for passenger cars, but is not \nqualified to provide national statistics, and it does not cover all OEMs, whereas \nCAAM does. The China Automotive Technology and Research Center  (CATARC) \nis a state-owned think tank, and collects car production numbers from vehicle \nidentification numbers and car sales numbers from vehicle insurance registrations. \nIn China, vehicle insurance is registered for the vehicle itself and not for the \nindividual driver, and is therefore useful for tracking the number of vehicles on the \nroad, including imports. The main differences between CATARC data and the other \nsources stem from exports and military or other cars that do not get registered, and \ninventory stocks of vehicle manufacturers. \nIn 2022 the total exports of passenger cars increased rapidly, making the \ndifferences between these data sources more apparent. In 2022 the export of \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 33  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \npassenger vehicles increased by almost 60%,  exceeding 2.5  million, while the \nimports of passenger vehicles decreased by almost 20% (950 000 to 770 000).  \nSimilar discrepancies between factory shipments and insurance registrations are \napparent in the Chinese bus and truck (commercial vehicle) market. In both 2021 \nand 2022, total volumes of factory shipments were substantially higher than \ninsurance registrations, implying net export shares of commercial vehicles of about \n9% in 2021 and more than 13% in 2022.  \nNumber of passenger car (top) and commercial vehicle (bottom) sales and \nregistrations in China reported by various sources, 2020-2022 \n \nIEA.

CC BY 4.0. \n3.6%, about one-quarter that of passenger cars. Current trends indicate that the \nelectric LCV market is catching up with that of electric cars , suggesting that the \ngap in terms of EV sales shares could narrow in the future. For the first time in \n2022, the increase in the share of electric LCVs outpaced that of electric \npassenger cars (albeit from a low base). This demonstrates that once a critical \ntipping point i n terms of favourability of total cost of ownership (TCO) has been \nachieved, commercial vehicle purchasers are likely to respond more rapidly  to \neconomic fundamentals than private consumers. Commercial vehicle owners \ntypically use their vehicles more intensively, and as they have an imperative to \nmaximise profit, EVs provide an opportunity to considerably reduce operating \ncosts. The experience of commercial owners can also provide learnings for the \nprivate consumers segment: better fleet and charging management could help \naddress concerns over range limitations. \nThe share of PHEVs in LCVs has remained very low; around 98% of both electric \nLCV sales and stock in 2022 were BEVs. It is likely that this reflects the economic \nfavourability of the battery electric powertrain \u2013 as opposed to plug-in hybrids \u2013 in \ncommercial operations characterised by intensive usage, regularity and \npredictability (in terms of driving range, geographic extent, and return-to-base for \novernight charging), as well as the lower maintenance and service costs of battery \nelectric LCVs . Battery electric LCV adoption may also be spurred on by the \ncontinuing expansion of low- and zero-emission zones. \nFigure 1.9 Electric light commercial vehicle sales and sales shares, 2018-2022 \n \nIEA.

CC BY 4.0. \nIn 2022, China led in terms of overall electric LCV sales with over 130 000 units \nsold, and nearly 15% of LCVs sold being electric. 7 Subsidies for battery electric \nand fuel cell trucks and vocational vehicles (including LCVs) have decreased in \nrecent years, but overall zero-emission commercial truck sales have been growing \nsince 2020, even as subsidies per vehicle have declined, indicating the increasing \ncommercial competitiveness of electric trucks.  \nIn terms of market share, Korea continued to lead in 2022 with 27% of LCV sales \nbeing electric (36 000 vehicles), but sales growth in 2022 slowed to half its level \nin the previous year. This may be due to changes to the subsidy scheme for LCVs \nand to the repealing in April 2022 of a policy that made obtaining commercial \nregistration permits easier for electric LCVs than ICE models (see Policy \ndevelopments and corporate strategy). \nLight commercial EV sales shares also grew substantially in the Nordic countries, \nwith Norway reaching 25%, Iceland 16%, and Sweden 13%. In all other key \nEuropean and North American national markets, shares are lower than 10%, and \ntypically less than the global average of 3.5%, but the rate of growth in market \nshare for electric LCVs was higher than for passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) \n(albeit from a lower baseline) across most leading EV markets, including the \nUnited States, Japan, and the European Union. \nElectric two-wheeler sales declined in China while global \nelectric three-wheeler sales continued to rise  \nGlobal electric two-wheeler sales totalled about 9.2 million in 2022, a drop of \nnearly 18% from 2021 (Figure 1.10). This drop is almost entirely attributable to the \ndip in sales of electric mopeds and motorcycles in China, which fell  from \n10.2 million in 2021 to under 7.7 million in 2022, even as the overall two-wheeler \nmarket there continued to grow. Supply chain challenges stemming from China\u2019s \npandemic-related restrictions  in 2022 hit the electric two-wheeler market \nparticularly hard, and in spite of growth in sales of premium domestic and imported \ntwo-wheelers (e.g. from BMW, Ducati and others) , the overall sales share of \nelectric two-wheelers dipped back below 50%.8 Despite the decline in sales, China \n \n7 Commercial truck sales in China are reported according to four gross vehicle weight (GVW) bins: less than 1.8 tonnes, 1.8-\n6 tonnes, 6-14 tonnes, and greater than 14 tonnes. These are reallocated to categories based on other external data sources \nto match IEA\u2019s harmonised global definitions of light commercial vehicles (less than 3.5 tonnes GVW), medium trucks (3.5-\n15 tonnes), and heavy trucks (15 tonnes GVW and above). \n8 As with other vehicle types, tracking new two-wheeler registrations (\u201csales\u201d) in China is difficult, as the official data source, \nCAAM, tracks factory shipments, and hence reports volumes that include exported vehicles. Tracking  is particularly difficult \nin the case of electric two-wheelers, however, as many data sources include pedal-electric bicycles and other small electric \nmopeds (see, for instance, a recent industry report  from Honda). Chinese data sources  give vehicle sales of electric two-\nwheelers at around 50 million in 2021, and 60 million in 2022, of which about 7.6 million are classified as motorcycles (China \nChamber of Commerce for Motorcycles). S ome of these attain top speeds of less than 50 km/hour, and so are excluded from \nthe above figures. In India, electric bicycles and mopeds with a top speed of less than 50 km/hour made up more than 80% \nof the market in 2021 and 2022. The accounting here includes only vehicles with a minimum top speed of 50 km/hr and that \nfit the UNECE definition of L1 or L3, based on data provided by MotorcyclesData.com. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 36  \nIEA.

A total of \n15 Indian states  have already adopted EV policies to promote stronger EV \ndeployment (and many more  are drafting them), the majority of which include \nadditional demand incentives. Bulk procurement schemes, the emergence of the \nbattery-as-a-service (BaaS) business model and India\u2019s draft battery  swapping \npolicy all give further impetus to the rapidly rising sales of electric three-wheelers. \nChina followed India in terms of electric three-wheeler sales, with nearly 350 000 \nunits sold in 2022. Together, China and India accounted for nearly 99% of global \nelectric three-wheeler sales. \nBox 1.3 Korea continues to lead fuel cell electric car growth \nIn 2022, the stock of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) increased 40 % compared \nto 2021, reaching over 72 000 vehicles globally. About 80% of the FCEVs are cars, \n10% trucks and almost 10% buses. In 2022, the fuel cell truck segment grew at a \nfaster rate than cars and buses, increasing 60%.  \nKorea is now home to over half of  all fuel cell cars globally. Two -thirds of the \nadditional 15 000 fuel cell cars that hit the road in 2022 were in Korea. This can be \nattributed in part to a policy landscape that supports FCEV production and sales, \nwhich has also led to Hyundai being the top fuel cell automaker.  \nThe United States holds the second largest FCEV stock, with over 15 000 FCEVs. \nMost of these are fuel cell cars, with a little more than 200 fuel cell buses. In 2022, \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 38  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nthe stock of FCEVs in the United States increased more than 20%, which is much \nless than the 60% growth in China, which has the third largest FCEV stock. \nHistorically, China has dominated the heavy-duty fuel cell vehicle segments (trucks \nand buses). This is still the case in 2022, with China home to over 95% of the \nglobal fuel cell truck fleet and almost 85% of the global fuel cell bus fleet. However, \nin 2022, China added over 200 fuel cell cars to its FCEV fleet after years of only \ndeploying buses and trucks. \nFor further details on the status of FCEVs and other hydrogen-based applications, \nsee the IEA Global Hydrogen Review r eport series. \nFuel cell electric vehicle and hydrogen refuelling station stock by region, \n2022 \n \nIEA.

Sales shares were also high in Sweden, Switzerland and Israel.  \nElectric trucks sales shares remain low across most major markets .

Electric truck sales for tractor-trailers and \ngarbage trucks in China have also grown rapidly from a low base.  \nUntil the past few years, the production and sales volumes of electric buses and \ntrucks ebbed and flowed based on subsidies. The central government introduced \nsubsidies totalling nearly CNY  30 billion (Chinese Yuan renminbi ) \n(USD 4.3 billion) in 2016 and 2017, the vast majority of which went to electric \nbuses; BYD buses alone received about CNY 10 billion (USD 1.5 billion). Despite \na progressive reduction in subsidies from 2018 onwards (total subsidies from \n2018-2021 were less than CNY 20 billion [USD 2.9 billion]), electric bus and truck \nsales began increasing in 2021 and grew again in 2022, a promising sign that they \nhave reached cost and performance metrics that make them increasingly \ncompetitive without government support. Cost reductions are also being driven by \nmarket consolidation and economies of scale. Indeed, China's commercial electric \ntruck sales (including both LCVs and medium- and heavy-duty trucks \u2013 see section \nabove on electric LCVs) dipped from a high of nearly 150 000 in 2017 (immediately \nfollowing the adoption of the subsidy) to a low point in 2020, at 59 000; before \nrebounding to reach 1 86 000 total electric truck sales in 2022, despite declining \nsubsidies on a per-vehicle basis in both 2021 and 2022. \nZero-emission vehicle model availability expanded in \n2022 in the medium- and heavy-duty truck segments \nThe number of models on offer for zero-emission trucks has continued to expand \nin 2022, with nearly 840 current and announced medium- and heavy-duty vehicle \nmodels in the Global Drive to Zero Emission Technology Inventory (ZETI) \ndatabase. \nThe trend of  new model development has shifted from buses to medium - and \nheavy-duty trucks. Of the 220 models that became available in 2022, more than \nhalf were either medium-duty trucks (over 60 models) or heavy-duty trucks (over \n50 models), reflecting the fact that truck manufacturers are increasingly gaining  \nconfidence in supplying larger, heavier zero -emission models with greater \npayloads. The majority (over 90%) of the already available medium -duty and \nheavy-duty trucks models are battery electric; 12 models of fuel  cell heavy-duty \ntrucks are currently available \u2013 and another 8 are due to become available in 2023-\n24.  \nOf commercially available bus and truck models in 2022, 60% (over 500  models) \nwere produced by OEMs headquartered in China. Another 20% (over 170 models) \nwere produced by North American OEMs, and 15 % ( over 120 models) by  \nEuropean OEMs.\n \n10 Box trucks are light commercial and medium -duty chassis cab trucks with an enclosed box -shaped cargo space in the \nback. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023   Trends and developments in EV markets \nPAGE | 41  \nIEA.

G iven their dominance in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery \nchemistries, China\u2019s CATL produces the vast majority of batteries for trucks . \nHowever, s purred on by industrial policies \u2013 the European Union\u2019s Green \nIndustrial Plan and the United States\u2019 IRA \u2013 truck makers have already begun to \nbuild or are announcing investments in new production facilities for heavy -duty \nbattery packs (such as Volvo\u2019s 2.7 GWh plant, which opened in Sweden in 2022). \nTruck makers have also entered collaborations with major cell makers, seeking to \nsecure further opportunities for vertical integration.  \nMore than 95% of heavy-duty trucks produced in China were equipped with LFP \ncathode chemistries in 2021. The durability and lower cost of LFP batteries make \nthem the preferred choice not onl y because of the high lifetime mileage needed \nfor commercial operations, but also because price is a concern for bus and truck \nbuyers: over half of truck purchases are leases or rely on loans. \nThe battery capacity of currently available commercial and announced models \ni\nncluded in the ZETI database w ithin a given vehicle type generally correlates with \ndeclared vehicle range (Figure 1.12). Table 1 shows how  average battery capacity \nhas generally increased across most bus categories from 2019 to 2022.

CC BY 4.0. \nActual vehicle range depends on the loaded vehicle weight, duty cycle, \naerodynamics and drivetrain efficiency, as well as environmental factors such as \ntemperature. In addition, as no harmonised test procedure currently exists to \nmeasure electric range for medium - and heavy-duty vehicles in any of the major \nmarkets where deployment of electric trucks has begun, manufacturers can \ndetermine their own methods to declare the electric range of the commercially \navailable and announced models. However, any standardised test procedure \nwould need to consider complicated issues of non-motive energy  consumption \n(e.g. heating ventilation and air conditioning in buses, cooling in  refrigerated \ntrucks), as well as the potential for buses and trucks to be used in vehicle-to-grid \napplications (as has been demonstrated, for instance, with electric school buses \nin the United States). In light of such considerations, a first regulatory step could \nbe to mandate that electric medium- and heavy-duty vehicle makers measure and \ndisclose the usable battery energy according to a yet-to-be-developed \nstandardised measurement procedure.  \nCharging infrastructure \nPublic charging points are increasingly necessary to \nenable wider EV uptake \nWhile most of the charging demand is currently met by home charging, publicly \naccessible chargers are increasingly needed in order to provide the same level of \nconvenience and accessibility  as for refuelling conventional vehicles. I n dense \nurban areas, in particular, where access to home charging is more limited, public \ncharging infrastructure is a key enabler for EV adoption. At the end of 2022, there \nwere 2.7 million public charging points  worldwide, more than 900 000 of which \nwere installed in 2022, about a 55 % increase on 2021 stock, and comparable to \nthe pre-pandemic growth rate of 50% between 2015 and 2019.  \nSlow chargers \nGlobally, more than 600 000 public slow charging points11 were installed in 2022, \n360 000 of which were in China, bringing the stock of slow chargers in the country \nto more than 1 million. At the end of 2022, China was home to more than half of \nthe global stock of public slow chargers. \nEurope ranks second, with 460 000 total slow chargers in 2022, a 50% increase \nfrom the previous year. The Netherlands leads in Europe with 117 000, followed \nby around 74 000 in France and 64 000 in Germany. The stock of slow chargers \n11 Slow chargers have power ratings less than or equal to 22 kW.

In Korea, slow charging stock has doubled year -on-year, reaching \n184 000 charging points. \nFast chargers \nPublicly accessible fast chargers, especially those located along motorways,  \nenable longer journeys and can address range anxiety, a barrie r to EV adoption. \nLike slow charger s, public fast chargers also provide charging solutions to \nconsumers who do not have reliable access to private charging, thereby \nencouraging EV adoption across wider swaths of the population. The number of \nfast chargers increased by 330 000 globally in 2022, though again the majority \n(almost 90%) of the growth came from China. The deployment of fast charging \ncompensates for the lack of access to home chargers in densely populated cities \nand supports China\u2019s goals for rapid EV deployment. China accounts for total of \n760 000 fast chargers , but more than 70% of the total public fast charging pile \nstock is situated in just ten provinces. \nFigure 1.13 I nstalled publicly accessible light-duty vehicle charging points by power \nrating and region, 2015-2022 \n \nIEA.

The total stock of fast chargers reached 28 000 \nat the end of 2022 . Deployment is expected to accelerate in the coming years \nfollowing government approval of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \nFormula Program  (N EVI). Al l US states, Washington DC, and Puerto Rico are \nparticipating in the programme, and have already been allocated USD 885 million \nin funding for 2023 to support the build-out of  chargers across 122 000 km of \nhighway ( see Policy support for EV charging infrastructure ). The US Federal \nHighway Administration has announced new national standards for federally \nfunded EV chargers to ensure consistency, reliabi lity, accessibility and \ncompatibility. As a result of the new standards, Tesla has announced it will open \na portion of its US Supercharger (where Superchargers represent 60% of the total \nstock of fast chargers in the U nited States) and Destination Charger network  to \nnon-Tesla EVs.  \nRatio of electric LDVs per public charger \nDeployment of public charging infrastructure in anticipation of growth in EV sales \nis critical for widespread EV adoption. In Norway, for example, there were around \n1.3 battery electric LDVs per public charging point in 2011, which supported \nfurther adoption. At the end of 2022, with over 17% of LDVs being BEVs , there \nwere 25 BEVs per public charging point in Norway. In general, as the stock share \nof battery electric LDVs increases, the charging point per BEV ratio decreases. \nGrowth in EV sales can only be sustained if charging demand is met by accessible \nand affordable infrastructure, either through private charging in homes or at work, \nor publicly accessible charging stations.  \n \n12 Previously a directive, the proposed AFIR, once formally approved, would become a binding legislative act, stipulating, \namong other things, a maximum distance between chargers installed along the TEN- T, the primary and secondary roads \nwithin the European Union.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 46  \nIEA.

Shading grows darker each year. \nSource: IEA analysis based on country submissions. \nIn many advanced markets, as the stock share of battery electric LDVs increased, the \ncharging point per BEV ratio has decreased. \nWhile PHEVs are less reliant on public charging infrastructure than BEVs, policy-\nmaking relating to the sufficient availability of charging points should incorporate \n(and encourage) public PHEV charging. If the total number of electric LDVs per \ncharging point is considered, the global average in 2022 was about ten EVs per \ncharger. Countries such as China, Korea and the Netherlands have maintained \nfewer than ten EVs per charger  throughout past years. In countries that rely \nheavily on public charging, the number of publicly accessible chargers has been \nexpanding at a speed that largely matches EV deployment.  \nHowever, in some markets characterised by widespread availability of home \ncharging (due to a high share of single-family homes with the opportunity to install \na charger) the number of EVs per  public charging point can be even higher. For \nexample, in the United States, the ratio of EVs per charger is 24, and in Norway \nis more than 30. As the market penetration of EVs increases, public charging \nbecomes increasingly important, even in these countries, to support  EV adopti on \namong drivers who do not have access to private home or workplace charging \noptions. However, the optimal ratio of EVs per charger will differ based on local \nconditions and driver needs. \n2015\n2016\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 20222022\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n0.0\n0.4\n0.8\n1.2\n1.6\n2.0\n2.4\n0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% 12% 13% 14% 15% 16% 17% 18% 19%\nBEV LDV stock share\nUnited States Norway China Netherlands\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 47  \nIEA.

During the early stages of EV adoption, it makes sense \nfor available charging power per EV to be high, assuming that charger utilisation \nwill be relatively low until the market matures  and the utilisation of infrastructure \nbecomes more efficient . In line with this, the European Union\u2019s provisional \nagreement on the AFIR includes requirements for the total power capacity to be \nprovided based on the size of the registered fleet.  \nGlobally, the average public charging power capacity per electric LDV is around \n2.4 kW per EV.

CC BY 4.0. \ncosts (e.g. the di fference between diesel and electricity  prices faced by truck \noperators, and reduced maintenance costs); and CAPEX subsidies to reduce the \ngap in the upfront vehicle purchase price. Since electric trucks can provide the \nsame operations with lower lifetime costs (including if a discounted rate is applied), \nthe time horizon in which vehicle owners expect to recuperate upfront costs is a \nkey factor in determining whether to purchase an electric or conventional truck. \nThe economics for electric trucks in long -distance applications can be \nsubstantially improved if charging costs can be reduced by maximising \u201coff-shift\u201d \n(e.g. night-time or other longer periods of downtime) slow charging, securing bulk \npurchase contracts with grid operators for \u201cmid-shift\u201d (e.g. during breaks), fast (up \nto 350 kW), or ultra-fast (>350 kW) charging, and exploring smart charging and \nvehicle-to-grid opportunities for extra income. \nElectric trucks and buses will rely on off-shift charging for the majority of their \nenergy. This will be largely achieved at private or semi-private charging depots or \nat public stations on highways, and often overnight. Depots to service growing \ndemand for heavy-duty electrification will need to be developed, and in many \ncases may require distribution and transmission grid upgrades. Depending on \nvehicle range requirements, depot c harging will be sufficient to cover most \noperations in urban bus as well as urban and regional truck operations. \nThe major constraint to rapid commercial adoption of electric trucks in regional \nand long-haul operations  is the availability of \u201cmid-shift\u201d fast charging . Although \nthe majority of energy requirements for these operations could come from \u201coff -\nshift\u201d charging, fast and ultra-fast charging will be needed to ex tend range such \nthat operations currently covered by diesel can be performed by battery electric \ntrucks with little to no additional dwell time (i.e. waiting). Regulations that mandate \nrest periods can also provide a time window for mid-shift charging if fast or ultra -\nfast charging options are available en route: the European Union requires \n45 minutes of break after every 4.5 hours of driving; the United States mandates \n30 minutes after 8 hours. \nMost commercially available direct current (DC) fast charging stations currently \nenable power levels ranging from 250-350 kW. The European Union\u2019s Alternative \nFuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) aims to enable mid-shift charging across  \nthe EU\u2019s core TEN-T network, which covers 88% of total long-haul freight activity, \nand along other key freight corridors . The provisional agreement reached by the \nEuropean Council and Parliament includes a gradual process of infrastructure \ndeployment for electric heavy -duty vehicles starting in 2025. Recent studies of \npower requirements for regional and long -haul truck operations in the \nUnited States and Europe find that charging power higher than 350 kW, and as \nhigh as 1 MW, may be required to fully recharge electric trucks during a 30- to 45-\nminute break.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 50  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nRecognising the need to scale up fast or ultra-fast charging as a prerequisite for \nmaking both regional and, in particular , long-haul operations technically and \neconomically viable, in 2022 Traton, Volvo, and Daimler established an \nindependent joint venture, Milence. With EUR 500 million in collective investments \nfrom the three heavy-duty manufacturing groups, the initiative aims to deploy more \nthan 1 700 fast (300 to 350 kW) and ultra-fast  (1 MW) charging points across \nEurope.  \nMultiple charging standards are currently in use, and technical specifications for \nultra-fast charging are under development. Ensuring maximum possible \nconvergence of charging standards and interoperability for heavy-duty EVs will be \nneeded to avoid the cost, inefficiency, and challenges for vehicle importers and \ninternational operators that would be created by manufacturers following divergent \npaths. \nIn China, co-developers China Electricity Council and CHAdeMO\u2019s \u201cultra ChaoJi\u201d \nare developing a charging standard for heavy -duty electric vehicles for u p to \nseveral megawatts. In Europe and the United States, specifications for the CharIN \nMegawatt Charging System (MCS), with a potential maximum power of 4.5 MW, \nare under development by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) \nand other organisations. The final MCS specifications, which will be needed for \ncommercial roll-out, are expected for 2024. After the first megawatt charging site \noffered by Daimler Trucks and Portland General Electric ( PGE) in 2021, at least \ntwelve high-power charging projects are planned or underway in the United States \nand Europe, including charging of an electric Scania truck  in Oslo, Norway, at a \nspeed of over 1 MW, Germany\u2019s HoLa project , and the Netherlands Living Lab \nHeavy-Duty and Green Transport Delta Charging Stations, as well as investments \nand projects in Austria, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom. \nCommercialisation of chargers with rated power of 1 MW will require significant \ninvestment, as stations with such high-power needs will incur significant costs in \nboth installation and grid upgrades. Revising public electric utility business models \nand power sector regulations, co-ordinating planning across stakeholders and \nsmart charging can all help to manage grid impacts. Direct support through pilot \nprojects and financial incentives can also accelerate demonstration and adoption \nin the early stages. A recent study outlines some key design considerations  for \ndeveloping MCS rated charging stations: \n\uf09f Planning charging stations at highway depot locations near transmission lines and \nsubstations can be an optimal solution for minimising costs and increasing charger \nutilisation.  \n\uf09f \u201cRight-sizing\u201d connections with direct connections to transmission lines at an early \nstage, thereby anticipating the energy needs of a system in which high shares of \nfreight activity have been electrified, rather than upgrading distribution grids on an \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 51  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nad-hoc and short -term basis, will be critical to reduce costs. This will require \nstructured and co- ordinated planning between grid operators and charging \ninfrastructure developers across sectors. \n\uf09f Since transmission system interconnections and grid upgrades can take 4- 8 \nyears, siting and construction of high-priority charging stations will need to begin \nas soon as possible. \n \nAlternative solutions include installing stationary storage and integrating local \nrenewable capacity, combined with smart charging, which  can help reduce  both \ninfrastructure costs related to grid connection and electricity procurement costs \n(e.g. by enabling truck operators to minimise cost by arbitraging price variability \nthroughout the day, taking advantage of vehicle-to-grid opportunities, etc.). \nOther options to provide power to electric heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) are battery \nswapping and electric road systems. Electric road systems can transfer power to \na truck either via inductive coils 13 in a road, or through conductive connections \nbetween the vehicle and road, or via catenary (overhead) lines. Catenary and \nother dynamic charging options may hold promise for  reducing the uncertainty of \nsystem-level costs in the transition to zero-emission regional and long-haul trucks, \ncompeting favourably in terms of total capital and operating costs. They can also \nhelp to reduce battery capacity needs . Battery demand can be further reduced, \nand utilisation further improved, if electric road systems are designed to be \ncompatible not only with trucks but also electric cars. However, such approaches \nwould require inductive or in-road designs that come with greater hurdles in terms \nof technology development and design, and are more capital intensive. At the \nsame time, electric road systems pose significant challenges resembling those of \nthe rail sector, including a greater need for standardisation of paths and vehicles \n(as illustrated with trams and trolley buses), compatibility across borders for long-\nhaul trips , and appropriate infrastructure ownership models. They provide less \nflexibility for truck owners  in terms of routes  and vehicle types , and have high \ndevelopment costs overall , all affecting their competitiveness relative to regular \ncharging stations. Given these challenges, such systems would most effectively \nbe deployed first on heavily used freight corridors, which would entail close co-\nordination across various public and private stakeholders. Demonstrations on \npublic roads to date in Germany and Sweden have relied on champions from both \nprivate and public entities . C alls for electric road system pilots are also being \nconsidered in the China, India, the United Kingdom and the United States. \n \n13 Inductive solutions are further from commercialisation and face challenges to deliver sufficient power at highway speeds. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 52  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nRecent developments in battery swapping \nBattery swapping entails switching a drained vehicle battery with a fully charged \nbattery at a swapping station. In general, battery swap-enabled vehicles can also \nbe charged via conventional plug-in charging infrastructure. \nBattery swapping offers advantages in terms of purchase price parity with ICE  \nvehicles and recharging times. In particular, offering the battery as a service \u2013 for \nexample based on a monthly subscription fee  \u2013 reduces upfront investment for \nvehicle owners. In addition, drivers can choose a right-sized  battery for daily \ncommuting and then upgrade to a larger battery ahead of a long journey.  \nBattery swapping also has the potential to improve battery management (e.g. to \nextend battery lifetime through controlled charging) , co-ordinate charging to \nreduce the impact on the grid, increase utilisation of renewable electricity, and \neven provide grid services that can generate revenue. Specifically, battery \nswapping stations can leverage the aggregation of batteries in order to provide \ngrid services. In traditional cases in which battery ownership and utilisation remain \nat individual vehicle level, more extensive communication and control measures \nare required to allow for the provision of grid services. \nHowever, battery swapping presents some disadvantages compared to \nconventional charging. Firstly , more than one battery is required per vehicle  to \nensure sufficient availability at swap stations , with  some companies currently \naveraging about two batteries per vehicle . This could affect critical material \ndemand and the associated environmental impacts, though given that battery \ncapacity per vehicle may decrease, the net impact is uncertain. Furthermore, the \ncapital investment required for a battery swap station can be high, given the cost \nof the spare batteries in addition to the infrastructure cost. Additional costs may \nalso be incurred if batteries are damaged during the swapping process. Estimates \nfor the costs for a single battery swap station range from USD  390 000 to \nUSD 1.4 million, including the structure, land requirement, labour, maintenance, \nelectricity and stored batteries. From a customer perspective, the lower resale \nvalue of an electric vehicle that does not include a battery  may be a deterrent. \nFinally, battery swapping either requires a degree of standardisation (see Policy \nincentives for battery swapping in China and India), or for batter y swap stations to \nbe tailored to certain vehicle makes or models. The success of battery swapping \nwill likely depend on regional  conditions, such as supportive policies and \nstandards, vehicle market structure, and vehicle applications.  \nVarious battery swapping business models, including battery leasing and BaaS \nbusiness models, are particularly interesting for commercial vehicles. Battery \nswapping is seeing growing adoption within the LDV sector, including two/three-\nwheelers, used for delivery or ride-hailing services. In particular, battery swapping \nfor two/three-wheelers is growing in Asian markets. The deployment of battery \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 53  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nswapping for trucks, however, is thus far limited to China, where the market is \ngrowing. China introduced buses with swappable batteries  for the 2008 Beijing \nOlympics, but the technology has not  developed as much as for other vehicle \nsegments. However, a number of projects in India focus on battery swapping for \nelectric buses, especially for intercity operations. Ashok Leyland (now Switch \nMobility), one of India\u2019s largest commercial vehicle manufacturers, set up the first \nelectric bus battery-swapping station in 2019. \nTwo/three-wheelers \nInternational Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT ) analysis suggests that \nbattery swapping for electric two-wheelers in taxi services (e.g. bike taxis) offer s \nthe most competitive TCO compared to point charging BEV or ICE two-wheelers. \nIn the case of last-mile delivery via a two-wheeler, point charging currently has a \nTCO advantage over battery swapping, but with the right policy incentives and \nscale, swapping could become a viable option under certain conditions. In general, \nas the average daily distance travelled increases, the battery electric two-wheeler \nwith battery swapping becomes more economical than point charging or gasoline \nvehicles. In 2021, the Swappable Batteries Motorcycle Consortium  was founded \nwith the aim to facilitate battery swapping of light-weight vehicles, including \ntwo/three-wheelers, by working together on common battery specifications. \nBattery swapping of electric two/three-wheelers is particularly gaining momentum \nin India. There are currently over ten different companies in the Indian market, \nincluding Gogoro, a Chinese Taipei-based electric scooter and battery swapping \ntechnology leader. Gogoro claims its batteries power 90% of electric scooters  in \nChinese Taipei, and the Gogoro network has more than 12 000 battery swapping \nstations to support over 500 000 electric two-wheelers across nine countries , \nmostly in the Asia Pacific region. Gogoro has now formed a partnership with India-\nbased Zypp Electric , w hich runs an EV-as -a-service platform for last-mile \ndeliveries; together, they are deploying 6 battery swapping stations and 100 \nelectric two-wheelers as part of a pilot project for business -to-business last-mile \ndelivery operations in the city of Delhi. At the beginning of 2023, they raised \nUSD 25 million, which they will use to expand their fleet to 200 000 electric two-\nwheelers across 30 Indian cities by 2025. Sun Mobility has a longer history of \nbattery swapping in India, with over 210 swapping stations across the country for \nelectric two- and three-wheelers, including e-rickshaws , with partners such as \nAmazon India. Thailand is also seeing corporate interest  in battery swapping \nservices for motorcycle taxi and delivery drivers. \nWhile most prevalent in Asia, battery swapping for electric two-wheelers is also \nspreading to Africa. For example, Rwandan electric motorbike start-up Ampersand \noperates battery swap stations, with a focus on serving motorcycle taxi operations \n \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 54  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nthat require long daily ranges. Ampersand has built ten battery swap stations in \nKigali and three in Nairobi, Kenya. These stations perform close to 37 000 battery \nswaps a month. \nTrucks \nFor trucks in particular, battery swapping can have major advantages over ultra-\nfast charging. Firstly, swapping can take as little as 3-5 minutes, which would be \ndifficult and expensive to achieve through cable-bas ed charging, requiring an \nultra-fast charger connected to medium- to high-voltage grids and expensive \nbattery management systems and battery chemistries. Avoiding ultra-fast \ncharging can also extend battery capacity, performance and cycle life. \nBattery-as-a-service (BaaS), separating the purchase of the truck and the battery, \nand establishing a lease contract for the battery, substantially reduces the upfront \npurchase cost (by as much as 50%).  In addition, since trucks tend to depend on \nlithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistries, which are more durable than \nlithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) batteries, they are well -suited for \nswapping in terms of safety and affordability.  \nHowever, the cost of building a station will likely be higher for truck battery \nswapping given the larger vehicle siz e and heavier batteries, which require more \nspace and specialised equipment to perform the swap. Another major barrier is \nthe requirement that batteries be standardised to a given size and capacity, which \ntruck OEMs are likely to perceive as a challenge to competitiveness as battery \ndesign and capacity is a key differentiator among electric truck manufacturers. \nChina is at the forefront of battery swapping for trucks due to significant policy \nsupport and use of technology designed to complement cable charging. In 2021, \nChina\u2019s MIIT announced that a  number of cities would pilot battery swapping \ntechnology, including HDV battery swapping  in three cities . Almost all major \nChinese heavy truck manufacturers, including FAW, CAMC, Dongfeng, Jiangling \nMotors Corporation Limited (JMC ), Shanxi Automobile, and SAIC , have now \nlaunched a battery swapping-enabled model of t heir battery electric trucks. I n 2022 \nalone, more than 12 000 battery swapping -enabled electric trucks were sold in \nChina.  \nCars \nChina is also the leader in battery swapping for passenger cars. Across all modes, \nthe total number of battery swapping stations in China stood at almost 2 000 at \nthe end of 2022, 50% higher than at the end of 2021. NIO, which produces battery \nswapping-enabled cars and the supporting swapping stations, runs more than \n1 300 battery swapping stations in China, reporting that the network covers more \nthan two-thirds of mainland China. Half of their swapping stations were installed \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 55  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nin 2022, and the company has set a target of 4 000 battery swap stations globally \nby 2025. The company claims  their swap stations can perform over 300 swaps \nper day, charging up to 13 batteries concurrently at a power of 20-80 kW.  \nNIO also announced plans to build battery swap stations in Europe as their battery \nswapping-enabled car models became available in European markets towards the \nend of 2022. The first NIO battery swap station in Sweden was opened in \nNovember 2022, and by the end of 2022, ten NIO battery swap stations had been \nopened across Norway, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. In contrast to \nNIO, whose swapping stations service NIO cars, the Chinese battery swapping \nstation operator Aulton\u2019s stations  support 30 models from 16 different vehicle \ncompanies.  \nBattery swapping could also be a particularly attractive option for LDV taxi fleets, \nwhose operations are more sensitive to recharging times than personal cars. US \nstart-up Ample currently operates 12 battery swapping stations  in the San \nFrancisco Bay area, mainly serving Uber rideshare vehicles.  \nBatteries \nBattery demand for EVs continues to rise \nAutomotive lithium -ion (Li -ion) battery demand increased by about 65% to \n550 GWh in 2022, from about 330 GWh in 2021, primarily as a result of growth in \nelectric passenger car  sales, with new registrations  increasing by 55% in 2022 \nrelative to 2021.  \nIn China, battery demand for vehicles grew over 70%, while electric car sales \nincreased by 80% in 2022 relative to 2021, with growth in battery demand slightly \ntempered by an increasing share of PHEVs. Battery demand for vehicles in the \nUnited States grew by around 80%, despite electric car sales only increasing by \naround 55% in 2022. While the average battery size for battery electric cars in the \nUnited States only grew by about 7% in 2022, the average battery electric  car \nbattery size remains about 40% higher than the global average, due in part to the \nhigher share of SUVs in US electric car sales relative to other major markets,14 as \nwell as manufacturers\u2019 strategies to offer longer all-electric driving ranges. Global \nsales of BEV and PHEV cars are outpacing sales of hybrid electric vehicles \n(HEVs), and as BEV and PHEV battery sizes are larger, battery demand further \nincreases as a result. \n \n14 For more information on the climate impact of SUVs, refer to the IEA\u2019s 27 February 2023 commentary on the subject.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 56  \nIEA.

Battery demand refers to automotive lithium-ion batteries. This analysis does not include \nconventional hybrid vehicles. \nSource: IEA analysis based on EV Volumes.  \nGlobal battery demand increased by 65% in 2022, mainly as a result of electric car sales in \nChina. \nThe increase in battery demand drives the demand for critical materials. In 2022, \nlithium demand exceeded supply (as in 2021) despite the 180% increase in \nproduction since 2017. In 2022, about 60% of lithium, 30% of cobalt and 10% of \nnickel demand was for EV batteries. Just five years earlier, in 2017, these shares \nwere around 15%, 10% and 2%, respectively. As has already been seen for  \nlithium, mining and processing  of these critical minerals will need to increase \nrapidly to support the energy transition, not only for EVs but more broadly to keep \nup with the pace of demand for clean energy technologies. 15 Reducing the need \nfor critical materials will also be important for supply chain sustainability, resilience \nand security. Accelerating innovation can help, such as through advanced battery \ntechnologies requiring smaller quantities of critical minerals, as well as measures \nto support uptake of vehicle models with optimised battery size and the \ndevelopment of battery recycling.  \n \n15 For more information on the future of supply and demand of critical minerals , refer to the Energy Technology Perspective \n2023 report.  \n0\n 100\n 200\n 300\n 400\n 500\n 600\n2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022\nGWh per year\nLDVs Bus Other\n0\n 100\n 200\n 300\n 400\n 500\n 600\n2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022\nGWh per year\nChina Europe United States Other\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 57  \nIEA.

This trend is driven mainly by the \npreferences of Chinese OEMs. Around 95% of the LFP batteries for electric LDVs \nwent into vehicles produced in China, and BYD alone represents 50% of demand. \nTesla accounted for 15%, and the share of LFP batteries used by Tesla increased \nfrom 20% in 2021 to 30% in 2022. Around 85% of the cars with LFP batteries \nmanufactured by Tesla were manufactured in China, with the remainder being \nmanufactured in the United States  with cells imported from China.

LFP batteries also contain phosphorus, which is used in food production. If \nall batteries today were LFP, they would account for nearly 1% of current \nagricultural phosphorus use by mass, suggesting that conflicting demands for \nphosphorus may arise in the future as battery demand increases. \nFigure 1.19 Electric light-duty vehicle battery capacity by chemistry, 2018-2022 \n \nIEA.

For example, silicon \ncan be used to replace all or some of the graphite in the anode in order to make it \nlighter and thus increase the energy density. Silicon-doped graphite already  \nentered the market a few years ago, and now around 30% of anodes contain \nsilicon. Another option is innovative lithium metal anodes, which could yield even \ngreater energy density when they become commercially available (Figure 1.20).  \n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2022\nLow-nickel High-nickel LFP Other\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 59  \nIEA.

This battery chemistry has the dual advantage of relying on \nlower cost materials than Li -ion, leading to cheaper batteries , and of completely \navoiding the need for critical minerals. It is currently the only viable chemistry that \ndoes not contain lithium. The Na-ion battery developed by China\u2019s CATL is \nestimated to cost 30% less than an LFP battery. Conversely, Na-ion batteries do \nnot have the same energy density as their Li -ion counterpart (respectively \n75 to 160 Wh/kg compared to 120 to 260 Wh/kg). This could make Na-ion \nrelevant for urban vehicles with lower range, or for stationary storage, but could \nbe more challenging to deploy in locations where consumer s prioritise maximum \nrange autonomy, or where charging is less accessible. There are nearly 30 Na-\nion battery manufacturing plants currently operating, planned or under \nconstruction, for a combined capacity of over 100 GWh, almost all in China. For \ncomparison, the current manufacturing capacity of Li -ion batteries is around \n1 500 GWh.  \nMultiple carmakers have already announced Na-ion electric cars, such as the \nSeagull by BYD, which has  an announced range of 300 km and is sold for \nUSD 11 600 (with possible discounts bringing the price down to USD 9 500), and \nthe Sehol EX10, produced by the VW-JAC joint venture, with a 250 km range. \nNCA\nNMC333\nNMC532\nNMC622\nNMC811\nLFP\nNa-ion\nGraphite\nSi-Gr\nLi metal\nCathode Anode\n0.0 0.6 1.2 1.8 2.4\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80%\nkg/kWh\nLithium\nAluminium\nNickel\nManganese\nCobalt\nIron\nPhosphorous\nOxygen\nCarbon\nSilicon\nSodium\nNitrogen\nShare in 2022\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 60  \nIEA.

To compare, the Wuling Mini BEV\u2019s range stands at 170 km, but \nBYD\u2019s Dolphin BEV, the second best-selling small BEV in China in 2022, with a \nsimilar range to the announced Na-ion cars, can cost more than USD 15 000. BYD \nplans to progressively integrate Na-ion batteries into all its models below \nUSD 29 000 as battery production ramps up. These announcements suggest that \nelectric vehicles powered by Na-ion will be available for sale and driven for the \nfirst time in 2023-2024, hence bringing the technology to a readiness level (TRL16) \nof 8-9, between first-of-a-kind commercial and commercial operation in the \nrelevant environment. In 2022, it was assessed  at TRL 6 (full prototype at scale) \nin the IEA Clean Technology Guide, compared to only TRL 3-4 (small prototypes) \nin the assessment from 2021, highlighting quick technological progress. \nCritical mineral prices can have an impact on chemistry choice \nThe variability in price and availability of critical minerals can also explain some of \nthe developments in battery chemistry from the last few years (Figure 1.21). NMC \nchemistries using an equal ratio of nickel, manganese, and cobalt (NMC333 or \nNMC111) were popular until 2015. Since then, cobalt price increases and \nconcerns affecting public acceptance of cobalt mining have contributed to a shift \ntowards low er-cobalt ratios, such as NMC622 , and then NMC811, which are \nnevertheless more difficult to manufacture. In 2022, the price of nickel increased , \nreaching a peak twice as high as the 2015-2020 average. This created incentives \nto use chemistries that are less reliant on nickel, such as LFP, despite their lower \nenergy density.  \nLithium carbonate prices have also been steadily increasing over the past two \nyears. In 2021, prices multiplied four- to five-fold, and continued to rise throughout \n2022, nearly doubling between 1 January 2022 and 1 January 2023. At the \nbeginning of 2023, lithium prices stood six times above their average over the \n2015-2020 period. In contrast to nickel and lithium, manganese prices have been \nrelatively stable. One reason for the increase in prices for lithium, nickel and cobalt \nwas the insufficient supply compared to demand in 2021 (Figure 1.18). Although \nnickel and cobalt supply surpassed demand i n 2022, this was not the case for \nlithium, causing its price to rise more strongly over the year. Between January and \nMarch 2023, lithium prices dropped 20%, returning to their late 2022 level. The \ncombination of an expected 40% increase in supply and slower growth in demand, \nespecially for EVs in China, has contributed to this trend. This drop \u2013 if sustained \n\u2013 could translate into lower battery prices. \n \n16 Technology Readiness Level (TRL) provides a snapshot of the maturity of a given technology. It has 11 steps ranging from \ninitial idea at step 1 to proof of stability reached at step 11.

Nickel prices are based on the London Metal Exchange, used here as a proxy for global pricing, \nalthough most nickel trade takes place through direct contracts between producers and consumers.

Pack production costs have \ncontinued to decrease over time, down 5% in 2022 compared to the previous year. \nIn contrast, cell production costs increased in 2022 relative to 2021, returning to \n2019 levels. This can be explained in part by the increasing prices of materials, \nwhich account for a significant portion of cell price, and of electricity, which affects \nmanufacturing costs, whereas efficiency gains in pack manufacturing help \ndecrease costs. Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) sees pack \nmanufacturing costs dropping further, by about 20% by 2025, whereas cell  \nproduction costs decrease by only 10% relative to their historic low in 2021. This \nwarrants further analysis based on future trends in material prices. \nThe effect of increased battery material prices differed across various battery \nchemistries in 2022, with the strongest increase being observed for LFP batteries \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0\n 100\n 200\n 300\n 400\n 500\n 600\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\nIndex (2015 = 100)\nIndex (1 Jan 2017 = 100)\nLithium carbonate Cobalt Nickel Copper Manganese Battery (right)\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 62  \nIEA.

Since LFP batteries contain neither nickel nor cobalt, which are \nrelatively expensive compared to iron and phosphorus, the price of lithium plays a \nrelatively larger role in determining the final cost. Given that the price of lithium \nincreased at a higher rate than the price  of nickel and cobalt, the price of LFP \nbatteries increased more than the price of NMC batteries. Nonetheless, LFP  \nbatteries remain less expensive than NCA and NMC per unit of energy capacity.  \nThe price of batteries also varies across different regions, with China having the \nlowest prices on average, and the rest of the Asia Pacific region having the highest \n(Figure 1.21). This price discrepancy is influenced by the fact that around 65% of \nbattery cells and almost 80% of cathodes are manufactured in China. \nFigure 1.22 Price index for selected battery chemistries, regions and metal price, \n2020-2023  \n \nIEA.

CC BY 4.0. \nPolicy developments and \ncorporate strategy \nOverview \nGlobal electric vehicle (EV) markets today differ widely, shaped by different levels \nof policy support, corporate activity, consumer preference and awareness, driving \npatterns and cultural specificities. The role of policy has been particularly \nsignificant in steering corporate strategy towards electrification and enabling \nconsumer uptake. \nIn today\u2019s major EV markets \u2013  including China, Europe and the United States \u2013  \nearly adoption was jump-started in many cases by policies to spur demand, such \nas vehicle purchase incentives. Direct incentives for carmakers were also used in \nChina. Many of these countries and regions are now seeing EV markets maturing, \nespecially for cars, for which sales shares are increasing rapidly. More developed \nmarkets such as China and several European countries  are now progressively \ndecreasing or phasing out incentive schemes for electric car s and shifting focus \ntowards other segments such as heavy transport and charging. \nAt the same time, some governments in major markets have increased their \ntargets for EV adoption further and are working to address other parts of EV supply \nchains, such as through policy support for vehicle and battery manufacturing and \ncritical mineral supply chains. Many other countries outside the major markets \nhave also started to introduce policy to support EV adoption in recent years, for \nthe first time in some cases. Overall, global spending by governments and \nconsumers on electric cars has significantly increased in the past few years, \nexceeding USD 400 billion in 2022. \nFor companies, policy requirements were an important driver for electrification in \nthe early years of EV adoption. With the exponential growth of electric car sales, \nhowever, it has become increasingly important for major incumbent carmakers to \noffer EVs as a key part of their portfolios in order to capture market share and \nmaintain a competitive edge. Competition is increasing, with a growing number of \nnew entrants, particularly from China but also from other emerging market and \ndeveloping economies (EMDEs), pushing the entire industry to accelerate \ndecarbonisation. Overall, corporate strategy among major carmakers is shifting, \nand \u2013 as in recent years \u2013 2022-2023 saw a series of important EV \nannouncements: fully electric fleets, cheaper cars, m ore investments, and \nintegration with battery making and critical minerals. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 64  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nThis section of the Outlook provides information on selected policy developments \nannounced between April 2022 and March 2023, since the last edition of the IEA \nGlobal Electric Vehicle Outlook in 2022.1  \nAs in recent years, most policies supporting EVs target the electric light-duty \nvehicle (LDV) segment, for which market maturity is most advanced and vehicle \navailability greatest. In 2022, more than 90% of global sales of LDVs were covered \nby policy that encourages EV uptake. Typical policies include fuel economy and \npollutant standards; zero-emission vehicle  mandates; economic and budgetary \nregulation for fuels and vehicles , such as through fiscal regimes and taxation; \npurchase incentives and subsidies; and bans on internal combustion engine (ICE)-\nonly vehicles.  \nThere is an increasing policy focus on the heavy -duty vehicle (HDV) segment, \nincluding medium freight trucks, heavy freight trucks and buses, and almost 70% \nof global HDV sales are now covered by EV policies. Countries are increasing \nfunding, committing to zero-emission vehicle 2  (ZEV) deployment targets and \nenacting HDV-specific policies for the first time. In 2022, 11 countries signed on \nto the Global M emorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Zero-Emission Medium- \nand Heavy-Duty Vehicles, bringing  the total number of signatories to 27. These \ncountries aim for 100% zero-emission new truck and bus sales by 2040. \nPolicies are also shifting towards electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), or \ncharging, and currently  almost 80% of global EV sales (LDV and HDV) are \ncovered by EVSE-related policy. Countries are increasingly dedicating funds to \nEVSE deployment, acknowledging that lack of charging infrastructure can be a \ncritical barrier to EV adoption. \nThe 2022-2023 period was notable for the announcement of policies  in the \nEuropean Union and United States \u2013 new CO 2 standards and the Inflation \nReduction Act (IRA ), respectively \u2013 which are expected to have a significant \nimpact on the pathway  to zero-emission road transport. In addition, several \nEMDEs outside China have developed specific industrial policy to support battery \nand EV production, seeking to capitalise on opportunities to strengthen domestic \nmanufacturing capacity. \n \n1 More comprehensive policy coverage and analysis, both regionally and prior to 2022-2023, can be found online in the \ninteractive IEA Global EV Policy Explorer. The explorer now includes policies and targets from around 90 countries, \ncovering the majority of the annual global sales shares of LDVs (over 90%), HDVs (70%), and two/three-wheelers (almost \n70%) respectively. In particular, new entries for EMDEs have been added. The explorer provides information on \ngovernment policies, ambitions and targets encouraging EV adoption across all road transport segments. It covers vehicle \ndeployment targets, financial incentives, manufacturing policies, as well as targets and financial support for charging \ninfrastructure.  \n2 Includes battery, plug-in, and fuel cell electric vehicles. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 65  \nIEA.

Countries are counted when they have at least one EV-\nsupportive policy in a given category, for example a purchase incentive, a national target for sales shares, or favourable \ntaxation. The share of global market coverage then represents the share of the vehicle market that countries with policies \naccount for. Coverage of EVSE-related policies is based on LDV and HDV sales. \nSource: IEA analysis based on announced policies; see the Global EV Policy Explorer for further details. \nAs of 2022, more countries have EV-related policies than do not, accounting for more than \n90% of global LDV sales and around 70% of HDV and two/three-wheeler sales.  \nZero-emission vehicle targets are a cornerstone of policy for transport \ndecarbonisation, and almost all such targets, with respect to market coverage, \nhave relatively short- to medium-term implementation dates. For LDV s, around \nhalf of annual global sales are covered by targets for 2035 or earlier, increasing \nonly slightly to 55% by 2050. While the vast majority of this coverage comes from \nChina, the European Union and the United States, there are promising increases \nin ambition in other markets. \n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nLDV EVSE HDV 2/3W\nShare of global market coverage\nGlobal market policy coverage\nEurope Asia Americas Africa RoW\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nLDV EVSE HDV 2/3W\nNumber of countries with EV policy\nCountry policy coverage\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 66  \nIEA.

The proposed EU heavy-duty vehicle CO2 standards include a 100% emission \nreduction target only for urban buses, and are thus not included in the chart. The Global Memorandum of Understanding \n(MoU) on Zero-Emission Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles is a pledge and is therefore also not included. \nSource: IEA analysis based on announced policies; see the Global EV Policy Explorer for further details. \nZero-emission vehicle targets are now in place in an increasing number of countries, \nincluding in emerging markets and developing economies. \nPolicy to develop EV supply chains \nPolicy increasingly aims to boost manufacturing, not just \ndeployment \nSeveral of the policies announced in 2022 and early 2023 relate to the \ndevelopment of EV manufacturing in addition to EV deployment.  \nIn China, the largest market for electric cars, supporting  EV manufacturers and \ncompanies through direct incentives along EV supply chains to ramp up domestic \nproduction is not a new phenomenon. The past decade has seen a sustained use \nof supply- and demand-side incentives for domestic firms, as well as joint ventures \nwith international carmakers. Support has been particularly prevalent at the local \nlevel in China, thereby stimulating national uptake and the development of several \nmajor EV companies. Regions and cities have also recently announced targets for \nmanufacturing, such as Chongqing\u2019s goal to produce and sell more than 10% of \nNetherlandsNorway\nIreland\nSri Lanka\nSlovenia\nUnited \nKingdom\nCanada\nCabo Verde\nCosta RicaIsrael\nSingapore\nJapan\n2025 2030 2035 2040 2050\nUnited \nKingdom\nAustria\nChile\nArgentinaEuropean \nUnion\nMexico\n2045\nAustria Cabo Verde\nCanada\nChile Mexico\nChile\nColombia Dominican \nRepublic\nLegend:\n100% electrified sales\n100% ZEV sales\n100% electrified stock\nICE ban\n100% zero-emission public bus sales\n100% zero-emission public bus stock\nDenmark\nEcuador\nIsrael\nNetherlands\nNew Zealand\nUkraine\nCosta Rica\nSingapore\nUnited \nKingdom\nLDV\nHDV\nUkraine\nUnited States\n(25%*)\nIceland\nDenmark\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 67  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nChina\u2019s new energy vehicles ( NEVs), 3  and Jilin\u2019s aim  to reach an annual \nproduction capacity of around 1 million NEVs, both by 2025, supported by policies \nfocusing on EV manufacturing.  \nThere were also notable announcements in other major markets, such as the IRA \nin the United States, and the Green Deal Industry Plan in the European Union. In \nIndia, the aims of the national Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to \nencourage domestic EV manufacturing have also been supported by subnational \ngovernment, such as in Tamil N\u0101du, where updated policy encourages local EV \nmanufacturing. A number of other examples in EMDEs further demonstrate this \ntrend, such as in Indonesia, which has introduced policy to invest in battery \nmanufacturing, and Ethiopia, which is offering tax exemptions for locally \nassembled EVs in order to attract investment. In July 2022, Morocco announced \nplans to build a large EV battery factory, and the country marked the completion \nof its first domestically produced battery electric vehicle (BEV) in December 2022 \nfollowing the reduction of tariffs  on lithium -ion cells in 2021 to encourage \nassembly. \nUnited States: Inflation Reduction Act \nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) , passed in August 2022, includes various tax \nincentives and funding programmes to meet the aim of building a clean energy \neconomy. Part of the Act concentrates on accelerating EV adoption, with \ndedicated funding drawn from the USD 369 billion allocated for  climate \ninvestments. \nThe Clean Vehicle Tax Credit introduces a new set of conditions for EV models to \nqualify for  incentives. From 2023 onwards, these conditions stipulate that final \nassembly must occur in North America, and that vehicles must have a 7 kWh \nbattery or greater (to exclude low-range plug-in hybrid electric vehicles [PHEVs]), \nbe under 6.35 t gross vehicle weight (GVW), and have a suggested retail price of \nless than USD 80 000 for vans, SUVs and pickup trucks, or USD 55 000 for other \nvehicles. In order to qualify for the incentive, the EV buyer\u2019s household income \nmust be below the limit set by the US Internal Revenue Service. These conditions \nopen eligibility for an incentive of up to USD 7 500 per vehicle: USD 3 750 if the \nbattery meets the critical mineral requirement, and another USD 3 750 if it meets \nthe component requirement. 4 Furthermore, from 2025, vehicles with any critical \nminerals from \u201cforeign entities of concern\u201d will not be eligible for the credit, and \nvehicles with battery components from such entities will be ineligible from 2024. \n \n3 The policy specifically refers to \u201cIntelligent and Connected New Energy Vehicles\u201d, and therefore may not necessarily mean \n10% of total NEV sales in China.   \n4 This requirement stipulates that: 1) in 2023, 40% or more of the battery critical minerals must be extracted or processed in \nthe United States or a US free trade country, or have been recycled in North America, gradually increasing to 80% in 2027 \nand beyond; and 2) in 2023, 50% of the value of the components in the battery must be manufactured or assembled in North \nAmerica, gradually increasing to 100% in 2029 and beyond. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 68  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nSeveral of the major US automotive manufacturers have submitted a list of specific \nmodels that comply with the new requirements, and removing the manufacturer \nsales cap of 200 000 means GM and Tesla can participate in the scheme. Of the \n37 models listed, 4 are PHEV s and 33 are BEVs. The average listed retail price \nfor the eligible PHEVs and BEVs is just below the USD  55 000 and USD 80 000 \nlimit for cars and SUVs , respectively, indicating original equipment manufacturer \n(OEM) corporate strategy to meet the eligibility criteria of the IRA, even if this \nimplies cutting prices in some cases.  The Act also commits USD 1 billion to \nincentives and infrastructure projects for HDVs between now and 2031. 5  For \nvehicles from approved manufacturers, with 15 kWh or more of battery capacity, \nthe tax credits are up to USD 40 000 per vehicle. \nIn addition to demand-side credits for vehicle purchase, the IRA includes supply-\nside Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credits. Under this scheme, the US \ngovernment provides subsidies for domestic battery production of up to \nUSD 35 per kWh, plus another USD 10 per kWh for module assembly. Assuming \naverage battery prices in 2022 are around USD  150 per kWh, these new US \nproduction incentives could account for nearly a third of total battery price. \nFinally, in addition to confirming that countries with existing free trade agreements \nhave preferred status as suppliers, the United States signed an MoU  with the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo and Zambia in January 2023, committing to  \nsupport development of a productive supply chain from mining to assembly. \nEuropean Union: Green Deal Industry Plan \nIn February 2023, the European Union presented the Green Deal Industrial Plan, \nwhich has  four pillars related to progress on net zero-related projects : faster \npermitting, financial support, enhanced skills , and open trade. The plan also \nincludes provision for the creation of a Critical Raw Materials Act, the proposal for \nwhich was issued in March 2023, with a focus on security of supply, extraction and \nenvironmental standards, as well as recycling. \nThe faster permitting for facilities, including battery production, will be formalised \nvia the proposed Net Zero Industry Act, providing simplified and predictable \nplanning approvals. As well as loosening rules on state aid until 2025, the financial \nsupport package of the plan attempts to allow faster access to essential subsidies \nand loans, to compensate businesses for high energy prices, to help ensure \nliquidity, and to reduce electricity demand. The plan also aims  to reskill workers \naffected by the green transition, and to establish Net Zero Industry Academies. \nLastly, the trade element focuses on improving the resilience of the EU\u2019s supply \nchains, opening trade with new partners and attracting private investment.  \n \n5 Also included in the budget is provision of \u201cworkforce development and training, and planning and technical activities\u201d.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 69  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nIn March 2023, the European Union proposed the Net Zero Industry Act , which \naims to meet 40% of the European Union\u2019s needs for strategic net zero \ntechnologies with EU manufacturing capacity by 2030. These technologies \nexplicitly include battery and storage technologies, and for batteries the aim is for \nnearly 90% of the European Union\u2019s annual battery demand to be met by EU \nbattery manufacturers , with a combined manufacturing capacity of at least \n550 GWh in 2030, in line with the objectives of the European Battery Alliance. \nThese announcements came just as CO2 standards for car sales over 2030-2035 \ntightened under the Fit for 55 package. \nIndia: Production Linked Incentives (PLI) \nThe Indian PLI on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage was \nannounced in late 2021 with the aim of boosting domestic battery manufacturing \nwith a budget of INR 181 billion (Indian rupees) (USD 2.2 billion). Specifically, the \ngovernment aimed to reach a cumulative 50  GWh in domestic manufacturing \ncapacity by allocating funding to companies based on the s ales of batteries \nmanufactured in India, disbursed over five years, and dependent on meeting a \ndomestic value-add of at least 25% in year 1, increasing to 60% in year 5. This is \nparticularly ambitious given that there is currently no significant domestic battery \ncell manufacturing in India, and the 50 GWh figure is 50% greater than anticipated \ndomestic demand as projected in the IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) in \n2025. The scheme attracted 10 bids with cumulative capacity of 128 GWh in early \n2022, and by July 2022, the government had assigned funding to 3 companies \u2013 \nReliance, Ola and Rajesh \u2013 for a total of at least 30 GWh of battery manufacturing \ncapacity with the remainder to be allocated to the next highest placed bidder(s). \nOther private companies are expected to establish an additional 95 GWh.  \nThe Automobile and Auto Component PLI scheme  has two parts: the Champion \nOEM incentive scheme, which grants incentives for sales of advanced automotive \ntechnology vehicles (battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles) ac ross all \nvehicle segments; and the Component Champion scheme, which provides \nincentives for sales of certain components for both ICE and electric vehicles. The \nbudgetary outlay is INR 260 billion (USD  3.2 billion) over five years, and the \nscheme has been s uccessful in attracting investments worth INR  677 billion \n(USD 8.3 billion), which will be spent over a period of five years. A total of 95 \napplicants had been approved under this scheme as of March 2022. In both \nschemes, the minimum domestic value-add requirement is 50%. \nLeveraging critical mineral resources to build domestic \nmanufacturing \nRecognition of the vital role of critical minerals in the EV transition has also \ncatalysed policy action.

CC BY 4.0. \nrace to secure supply as EV demand increases, governments are seeking to \nposition themselves in global supply chains, with a focus on increasing domestic \ncapacity. It will be important to ensure these new supply chains for critical minerals \nare ethical and environmentally sustainable into the future. \nThe European Union\u2019s  December 2022 proposed revisions to the EU Battery \nDirective i ntroduce new rules for the production, recycling, and repurposing of \nbatteries. The European Union also proposed the Critical Raw Materials Act  in \nMarch 2023, which aims, by 2030, to achieve extraction capacity of 10% of the \nEuropean Union\u2019s annual consumption of strategic raw materials; processing \ncapacity for 40%; and recycling capacity for 15%. Objectives also include \ndiversifying the origin of imported materials to increase supply chain security and \nresilience, and improving the environmental sustainability of mineral -related \nactivities.  \nIn the United States, the importance of critical minerals and the preference for \ndeveloping domestic capacity has been underlined by the stipulation under the \nIRA that half of the vehicle subsidy is dependent on meeting the critical mineral \nrequirement. \nInitiatives to stimulate domestic manufacturing and ensure supply of critical \nminerals are also underway in many other countries. Australia is aiming to \naccelerate lithium production for both export and domestic downstream \nprocessing. Recent policy developments have included a consultation on the \nAustralian Made Battery Plan , which sets out an AUD  100 million (Australian \ndollars) (USD 65 million) budget proposal for domestic battery manufacturing \nprojects in Queensland, and on a new Critical Minerals Strategy . Like Chile, \nAustralia has a fre e trade agreement with the United States, meaning greater \nsynergy with the IRA than in countries not covered by such agreements. Argentina \nsees an opportunity to build a battery manufacturing industry  that would create \n2 500 jobs by 2030, and is considering the introduction of a domestic market quota \nof 5%, potentially increasing to 20%, to guarantee domestic industry access to \nlithium. Japan aims to increase domestic production of vehicle batteries to \n100 GWh by 2030 under the Green Growth Strategy. In 2022, Japan earmarked \nJPY 331.6 billion (Japanese yen) (USD  2.5 billion) to develop materials for \nmagnets and batteries to reduce the dependency on rare earth elements and \nlithium, including those used for EV applications. In Mexico, a decentralised public \nbody, Lithium for Mexico , was created in August 2022, recognising lithium as \nstrategic mineral  and nationalising the value chain, with a target that 50% of \nvehicles produced in Mexico will be ZEVs by 2030. Russia is aiming to leverage \nminerals to develop a battery industry, and for no less than 10% of car production \nto be EVs in 2030.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 71  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nIn 2020-2021, India imported lithium-ion cells worth USD 1 billion, more than 95% \nof which w ere from Hong Kong and China, according to trade data. To reduce \ndependency on imports, in 2022 India issued Battery Waste Management Rules , \nwhich aim at recycling or refurbishing all types of batteries, including those of EVs. \nThe rules also set the goal of increasing the recycled content of EV batteries to \n20% by 2030, including for imported products. In February 2023, India announced \nits first inferred lithium deposits of 5.9 Mt.6 If confirmed, this may become a game-\nchanger for India and for global cell manufacturing.  \nOther countries are also positioning themselves as potential players in the EV \nsupply chain: In 2023, Iran claimed to have identified lithium reserves, which if \nconfirmed could amount to 8.5 Mt, or the second largest such reserves in the \nworld. \n \nBox 2.1 Promoting electric vehicle adoption beyond targets and \nsubsidies \nExpansion of Low-Emission Zones or similar policies \nLow-Emission Zones (LEZs) are increasingly common, particularly in Europe, and \nthey may encourage EV adoption in the future, provided they are able to address \nacceptance and equity issues . London and Milan provide examples of LEZs that \nhave been in place for several years. In London, the Ultra -Low Emission Zone \nintroduced in 2021 will expand across all boroughs from August 2023 onwards: a \nvehicle driving in the area without meeting the emissions standards will face a daily \ncharge of up to GBP  12.5 (USD 15.5). Milan  has  banned older petrol and diesel \nvehicles (based on the engine\u2019s Euro classification) from entering the city during \nweekdays, subject to a fine, with only the cleanest vehicles permitted by 2030.  \nIn France, the scope of existing LEZs expanded in 2022 and 2023, with the \ngovernment requiring the adoption of LEZs in all municipalities with more than \n150 000 inhabitants  by 2024, eventually covering municipalities in m ore than 40 \nregions. Similarly, Spain has mandated LEZs in municipalities with more than \n50 000 inhabitants, covering 70% of Spanish cities. In the Netherlands, Amsterdam \nis extending its LEZs in 2025 with the goal of emission-free traffic by 2030, as is \nUtrecht, and the government aims for at least 30 cities to have implemented a zero-\nemission zone for logistics by 2030 (e.g. delivery, vans). In Scotland, a LEZ will be \nintroduced in Glasgow in June 2023, with three other cities following in 2024. In \norder to facilitate the change, a scrappage scheme  for people living in a ffected \nareas has been launched. Similarly, in Belgium, the LEZs that came into force at \nthe start of 2023 were paired with a scrappage scheme. Elsewhere, China has \ncreated national pilot ecological civilisation zones, which are regions for air pollution \n \n6 The total viable resource will be significantly lower than the inferred resource.   \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 72  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nprevention and control with associated targets for NEV deployment . Although the \nregulations pertaining to the restrictions applied are not yet all fully defined, they are \nexpected to have an impact on EV sales. \nInterest-free or low-interest loans \nAffordability can be a barrier to EV adoption, particularly among lower -income \nhouseholds, and some governments have sought to facilitate greater uptake by \nproviding low-interest loans. In 2022, Scotland offer ed a suite of interest-free loans \nto both individuals and businesses for both new and used BEVs and PHEVs. The \ncurrent round of funding is fully subscribed. In Australia, the Australian Capital \nTerritory offers interest-fr ee loans of up to AUD  15 000 (more than USD 10 000), \nwith a repayment period of up to 10 years, to help bridge potential price premiums \nrelative to ICE equivalents . From 2023 in France, as a two year - trial, interest-free \nloans will be offered to lower-income households in LEZs who would like to change \nto an EV. Since 2022, the Canada Infrastructure Bank  has  offered low- or zero-\ninterest loans for the purchase of zero-emission buses , with repayments sourced \nfrom savings generated by the lower operating costs. Slovenia offers subsidised \nloans to people wishing to purchase an EV as part of an Eco Fund. \nPolicy support for electric light-duty vehicles \nMore ambitious policy-making sets course for zero-\nemission driving \nNew EU standards introduce deadlines and increase targets \nOver the past year there has been substantial progress towards adopting \nlegislation in line with reducing emissions in the European Union by at least 55% \nby 2030, as outlined in the Fit for 55 pac kage. In March 2023, the European Union \nadopted new CO2 standards for cars and vans r equiring a 55% and 50% reduction \nin emissions of new cars and vans by 2030 (compared to 2021), and 100% for \nboth by 2035. As stated in the regulation, the Commission will also submit a \nproposal to allow for the registration of vehicles running exclusively on CO2-neutral \ne-fuels after 2035.\nIn June 2022, the European Parliament al so called for amendments to r egulations  \nregarding the default utility factor for PHEVs, which represents the share of \ndistance travelled using the battery compared to the distance travelled using the \nICE. Consequently, from 2025 the utility factor (with its effect on vehicle emissions) \nwill be based on the 2022 ICCT- Fraunhofer study of r eal -world data rather than \nestimates, substantially increasing the assumed emissions. This is expected to \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 73  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nsignificantly decrease the incentive for carmakers to use PHEVs to meet European \nfleet targets. As of 2027, the updated methodology will be based on an even split \nof private and company cars, as the latter  have been responsible for an even \ngreater gap between assumed and actual performance. Furthermore, it is \nproposed that f rom January 2027 the utility factor will be changed to reflect the \nlatest results of on-board fuel consumption monitoring devices. \nTighter Euro 7 regulations expand coverage of emissions \nIn November 2022, the European Commission proposed new Euro 7 emissions \nstandards for cars, vans, trucks and buses. The proposed emission standards are \nintended to be more reflective of real driving conditions, particularly city driving, \nand regulate not just tailpipe emissions, but also emissions from brakes and tyres \n\u2013 including for EVs. The standards are also intended to reinforce new stricter air \nquality standards proposed in October 2022.  \nAs with the U nited Nations regulations ( see \u201c Globally harmonised technical \nregulations for safer and cleaner electric vehicle deployment\u201d), the Euro 7 \nemissions standards would introduce minimum performance standards for LDV \nbattery durability of 80% by year 5 or 100 000 km, and 70% from years 5 to 8 or \n160 000 km.7 Also included are nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions reductions of 35% \nfor LDVs and 56% for HDVs, and tailpipe particle emissions reductions of 13% for \nLDVs and 39% for HDVs. These limits cannot be exceeded before 200 000 km or \n10 years of driving, double the previous requirements. They represent an \nanticipated cost increase  of EUR 90 to 150 (USD  95 to 160) for LDVs, and \nEUR 2 600 (USD 2 750) for HDVs compared to Euro 6/VI. \nBox 2.2 Globally harmonised technical regulations for safer and cleaner \nelectric vehicle deployment \nTechnical regulations and safety  \nIn addition to fiscal policies, technical regulations are key enablers of mass \nadoption, by ensuring safe, clean and sustainable operation, and thereby increasing \nconsumer confidence. Alongside representatives from governments, industry and \ncivil society, the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, hosted by \nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE ), develops legally \nbinding technical regulations on vehicle design and construction.  \nIn 2018, the UN introduced performance-oriented requirements to address potential \nsafety risks of EVs in both LDVs and HDVs. The requirements are divided into in-\n \n7 These limits apply to M1 vehicles (passenger cars with up to 8 seats). The limits for N1 vehicles (vans less than 3.5 t) are \n75% and 65% respectively.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 74  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nuse (occupant protection, charging, safety of the rechargeable energy storage \nsystem), and post-crash (electrical isolation, battery integrity etc.) categories.  \nEV-specific occupant protections have also been included in the five other UN \nRegulations dealing with vehicle collisions. Work to improve the 2018 regulation is \nongoing, with experts considering the flamm ability, toxicity and corrosiveness of \nvented gas, energy storage system vibration profile, water immersion, and thermal \npropagation. Thermal propagation is of particular importance in light of recent \ninstances of EV fires, which are extremely difficult to extinguish. The second phase \nof this work is expected to culminate in the adoption of an amendment in 2024.  \nEnvironmental performance \nSimilar regulatory activities to aid clean deployment  of EVs are ongoing, with \n27 countries8 committed to transposing minimum battery durability requirements in \nHEVs, PHEVs, and BEVs into their national legislation after the requirements were \nadopted by the UN in April 2022. The new provisions require manufacturers to \ncertify that the batteries will lose less than 20% of their initial capacity over 5 years \nor 100 000 km, and less than 30% over 8 years or 160 000 km. They are equal to \nthe provisions in the proposed  Euro 7 regulations , but less stringent than the \nprovisions adopted in California. The scope of the work is now extending to HDVs,  \na sector expected to electrify rapidly in the coming years. \nSuch initiatives are crucial for increasing the environmental performance of EVs \nbeyond their low emissions output, eas ing the pressure on in -demand critical raw \nmaterials needed for their production, and reduc ing waste from used batteries. A \nprocedure to measure brake particulate emissions has also been developed at the \nUN and has already been included into the Euro 7 proposal. Elsewhere, following \nthe forthcoming development of a harmonised procedure to determine the carbon \nfootprint of all vehicle types, a draft proposal from the UN on automotive Life Cycle \nAssessment (LCA) is expected to be adopted in 2025. \nGreater ambition for US states under Advanced Clean Cars II \nIn November 2022, the California Air Resources Board approved  the Advanced \nClean Cars II (ACC II) rule, which sets a minimum ZEV sales shares for passenger \nLDVs ranging from 35% in 2026 to 100% in 2035. 9 Any vehicle sold from 2035 \nonwards must be a zero-emission vehicle or PHEV. This follows sustained support \nfor low - and zero-emis sion vehicles in California in the past decades, such as \nthrough the zero-emission vehicle credits. While the regulation can only take effect \nafter a waiver is granted to California by the US Environmental Protection Agency, \n \n8 Australia, Canada, China, European Union ( representing Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, \nLuxembourg, Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden), India, Japan, Malaysia, Norway, Korea, \nRussia, South Africa, Tunisia, United Kingdom and United States. \n9 Includes passenger cars, SUVs, and pickup trucks, but not LCVs, which accounted for 6% of US LDV sales in 2022. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 75  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nother states have already followed California\u2019s lead. Vermont, Washington, \nOregon and New York have all adopted ACC  II, altogether representing about \n20% of US passenger LDV sales. Currently, Massachusetts, Delaware and \nColorado have also either begun the process to adopt ACC II or have announced \nintentions to do so, which would bring the share of sales covered by the rule to \nalmost 25%.  \nNational plans in many countries pave the way for zero-\nemission car transport \nIn 2022-2023, more and more countries proposed policy to accelerate electric car \nadoption, either by strengthening existing plans or introducing a support \nmechanism for the first time. \nIn Europe, t he United Kingdom br ought forward the date to end the sale of fully \nICE cars and vans to 2030, five years earlier than previously announced, with a \nfull transition to 100% ZEV sales by 2035. 10 In March 2023, the government laid \nout proposed ZEV sales share trajectories  f or cars and vans to reach the 2035 \ntarget.  \nGreece, which had a previous target of 30% ZEV sales share b y 2030, \nstrengthened its policy to only allow the sale of zero-emission LDVs from then \nonwards. In Switzerland a tar get first established in 2018 for a 15% electric car \nsales share by 2022 has been surpassed, reaching 25% in 2022, building on \nstrong collaboration and investment across around 50 leading organisations \nthrough the Electromobility Roadmap. The new target stands at 50% electric car \nsales share by 2025. Italy\u2019s su bsidy sche me has also been renewed with a focus \non scrapping older, more polluting ICEs, similar to a scheme in Singapore. S pain \nhas a similar focus on scrappage, accompanied by support for lower -income \nindividuals. In Denmark, c hanges to taxation aim to make EV company cars more \nattractive, while in Finland, i mport and annual taxes for EVs have been \nsignificantly reduced. Austria r enewed its EV subsidy  in 2023, applying the same \nrates as the previous year. 11 Croatia and Cyprus12 both began subsidising EV \npurchase in 2022.  \n10 Between 2030 and 2035, new cars and vans can be sold if they have significant zero- emission capability, which would \ninclude some plug-in and hybrid electric vehicles. The definition of significant zero- emission capability will be consulted on \nlater this year. \n11 Rates for commercial applicants have reduced between 2022 and 2023. \n12 Note by the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye: The information in this document with reference to \u201cCyprus\u201d relates to the southern part \nof the Island.

CC BY 4.0. \nIn 2022, Canada increased its national ambition for LDV deployment, with current \ngoals to achieve a zero-emission sales share of 20% by 2026, 60% by 2030 and \n100% by 2035. On the provincial level, British Columbia has increased its 2030 \ntarget to 90%. \nHaving funded a charging infrastructure programme since 2020, in February 2022 \nAustralia also started providing competitive grant funding supporting the purchase \nof EVs (both light- and heavy-duty) for commercial use. The total funding amounts \nto AUD  128 million (USD 89 million) and is a component of the expanded \nAUD 500 million (USD 346 million) Future Fuels Fund. In May 2022, New Zealand \npublished its first comprehensive emissions reduction plan. It aims for 30% of the \nLDV stock to be ZEVs by 2035. Electric cars accounted for over 10% of new sales \nin 2022, despite New Zealand only introducing a purchase subsidy in mid-2021. \nThis also covers imports of used vehicles, given their prevalence in the country, \nas well as several non-purchase related incentives.  \nJapan's Green Growth Strategy, announced in 2021, sets targets to reach 100% \nelectrification of LDV by 2035, and the 2023 Act on the Rational Use of Energy \ntracks and accelerates the targets set under the Strategy. \nIn EMDEs, governments are also increasing ambition. EVs are viewed as an \nopportunity to reduce air pollution, mitigate climate impacts and decrease reliance \non energy imports. The EV policies being introduced commonly take the form of \ntax exemptions for EVs, equipment and parts, as well as purchase incentives, \nmandates, and deployment targets.  \nIn Indonesia, government vehicles have been required to be electric since 2022, \nand EV purchase subsidies have been put in place from 2023. In Seychelles, the \naim is for 30% of new vehicles sales to be electric by 2030 and the forthcoming \nNational Electric Mobility Strategy will contain a target of 100% of buses to be \nelectric by 2050. In Panama, 40% of the stock of selected public vehicles are to \nbe EVs by 2030. Viet Nam has introduced a net zero emissions target for the \ntransport sector in 2050, aiming to use vehicles powered by 100% electricity and \ngreen energy, with a ban on the production, assembly and import of fossil fuel -\npowered vehicles in 2040. Ghana \u2019s recently released strategy contains a target \nthat 4%, 16%, and 32% of new sales are to be EVs in 2025, 2030, and 2050, \nrespectively. In addition, countries recently proposing tax -related policies include \nAngola, Brazil (following previous tax exemptions for imports of electric cars dating \nback to 2015), Ecuador, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, and \nViet Nam.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 77  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nPurchase incentives are being adjusted in more \nadvanced markets \nChina: local action ramps up as national subsidies phase out \nIn China, December 2022 saw the end of the national  NEV subsidy scheme, \noriginally aimed for phase-out two years earlier, and following a gradual reduction \nof national subsidies for NEV purchases since  2017. Meanwhile, with a sales \nshare of almost 30% in 2022, China\u2019s NEV market has surpassed the country\u2019s \ntarget of a 20% sales share by 2025. T he extended vehicle purchase tax \nexemption for NEVs will remain as the main national-level financial incentive until \nthe end of 2023.  \nMoreover, road transport electrification is stated as a goal  in multiple guiding \nstrategies. To reduce air pollution, China aims to reach a 50% NEV sales share \nby 2030 in its \u201ckey air pollution control regions\u201d, which combined account for nearly \n80% of China\u2019s car market. In addition, China\u2019s national action plan to reach \ncarbon peaking before 2030 sets out a target for the sales share of NEVs to reach \naround 40% by 2030. \nMeanwhile, targets and favourable policies at the regional level continue to play \nan important role. In line with the country\u2019s national action plan , 18 Chinese \nprovinces currently have explicit NEV targets as part of carbon peaking policies, \naiming for 40% of NEV sales share by 2030, with Tianjin at 50%. Regional sectoral \nstrategies and local 14th Five-Year Plans also set more ambitious targets in some \ncases, such as Shenzhen\u2019s aim to achieve a 60% NEV sales share by 2025, and \nShanghai\u2019s BEV sales share target of 50% by 2025. Several regional governments \nannounced local incentives at the beginning of 2023; for example, Zhengzhou and \nWuxi are providing vouchers for NEV purchases, while Beijing and Shanghai both \nannounced incentives to replace an ICE vehicle with a NEV.  \nThe focus and level of incentives are changing as markets \nmature \nIn addition to China, many other countries in which EV markets are maturing are \nnow also reducing or changing the nature of purchase incentives:  \n\uf09f In 2023, Norway reintroduced value-added tax (VAT) on EVs costing more than \nNOK 500 000 (Norwegian kroner) (USD 52 000), meaning only the most \nexpensive models would see price increases. Norway proposed to replace the \nVAT exemption with a new subsidy scheme, though few details have been \nreleased to date. Other advantages and incentives have also been gradually \nreduced.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 78  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \n\uf09f In the United Kingdom, s ubsidies for electric cars ended in 2022, having exceeded\na 20% sales share, after the available grant was gradually reduced bet ween 2016 \nand 2021.13 Subsidies remain in place for electric taxis, vans and trucks, as well \nas for company cars with new tax exemptions, and the focus on charging is also \nincreasing.  \n\uf09f Germany and Ireland both lowered purchase incentive levels in 2023.\n\uf09f The Netherlands has  been reducing premiums year- on-year, with a EUR  400\n(USD 420) reduction between 2022 and 2023. \n\uf09f Sweden had  first planned to tighten the cap on purchase incentives for electric\ncars from SEK 70 000 (Swedish kronor) (USD 7 000) in 2022 to SEK  50 000 \n(USD 5 000) in 2023, following an increase from SEK 60 000 (USD 6 000) in early \n2021. Then, in light of closer price parity between electric and ICE cars, Sweden \nannounced t hat the purchase incentive would expire from November 2022 \nonwards. \n\uf09f After increasing the incentive in order to boost  sales during the Covid-19\npandemic, France red uced incentives  from EUR 7 000 (USD 7 400) in 2021 to  \nEUR 6 000 in 2022 (USD 6 300) and EUR 5 000 in 2023 (USD 5 300). However, \nthe purchase incentive for lower- income households was increased from \nEUR 6 000 (USD 6 300) in 2022 to EUR 7 000 (USD 7 400) in 2023 in order to \nimprove equity of access to EVs. \n\uf09f In Korea, the government promotes EVs by applying higher subsidy amounts to\nvehicles with greater fully electric range. The maximum passenger car incentives \nslightly decreased from KRW 7 million (Korean won) (USD 5 400) to KRW \n6.8 million (USD  5 300) in 2023, though consumers can benefit from local \nsubsidies as  well. For electric LCVs , the incentives per vehicle decreased from \nKRW 14 million (USD 10 800) to KRW 12 million (USD 9 300) in 2023. However, \nwith around 30% more passenger cars and commercial vehicles subsidised, total \ngovernment funding for electric LDV subsidies increased f rom KRW  1 561 billion \n(USD 1.2 billion) in 2022 to KRW 1 676 billion (USD 1.3 billion) in 2023. \nAdditionally, in April 2022, Korea ended t heir policy of free light commercial \nvehicle (LCV) registration, yet has remained a leader in electric LCV deployment \nin 2022, averaging 27% of sales over the year.  \n\uf09f In 2022, Japan increased their EV subs idy s cheme to JPY  70 billion\n(USD 530 million) \u2013 doubling support f or BEV purchases up to JPY  850 000 \n(USD 6 500) and JPY 550 000 (USD 4 200) for PHEV. \nStronger policy preference for fully battery electric options\nRecent developments indicate possible strengthening of policy support for battery \nelectric cars  over PHEVs. In Europe, for example, Belgium, Finland, the \nNetherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom supported BEVs over the 2019-\n13 The grant was first available in 2011 and capped at 25% of the vehicle cost (to a maximum of GBP 5 000 (USD 6 170)); \nthis was then set to GBP 4 500 (USD 5 550) in 2016, reducing between GBP 500 and GBP 1 000 (USD 620 and 1 230) per \nyear thereafter.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 79  \nIEA.

In 2022, Ireland decided to end subsidies for PHEVs, \nfollowed in 2023 by Germany. \nIn China, Shanghai off ers purchase subsidies for BEVs but not for PHEVs, and \nseveral Indian states have set BEV-specific targets without including PHEVs. The \nUnited States and Canada have maintained the same level of support for PHEVs \nsince 2019. In California, however, a 40 mile (65 km) minimum ful ly electric range \nis being introduced for PHEVs. The IRA is now also stipulating a minimum of  \n7 kWh battery capacity  to qualify for subsidies, thereby excluding low -range \nPHEVs.  \nFigure 2.3.

Including specific targets \ndemonstrates a degree of confidence in a country\u2019s ability to meet its stated goal. In \n2022, 19 parties updated their NDCs  ahead of a UN synthesis report i n  October \n2022.14 It showed that 41% of NDCs, for around 80 countries, included electrification \nof road transport as a mitigation measure. \nIn this context, NDC submissions from 50 key EMDE markets were analysed to \nascertain if - and to what extent - electrification of transport has become part of \nEMDEs\u2019 mitigation strategies. Collectively , these EMDEs account for over 40 % of \nglobal LDV sales and almost 90% of LDV sales in all EMDEs.  \nElectric vehicle ambitions and targets in emerging markets and developing \neconomies \nIEA.

Of these, four \ncountries have EV ambitions or targets for both LDVs and buses, three countries \nhave LDV targets only, and four others only have bus targets. In addition, two African \ncountries (Mauritius and Rwanda), while not having any specific EV target, have \nidentified vehicle electrification as a key strategy and are monitoring adoption \nmetrics. \n14 13 more countries have updated their NDCs since the synthesis report of 23 September 2022. \n0\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n 10\n 12\n 14\nNDC Non-NDC LDV only Bus only LDV and\nbus\nOther LDV Bus LDV and\nbus\nOther\nEV targets/\nambitions\nNDC\nEV targets/ambitions\nNon-NDC\nEV targets/ambitions\nNumber of countries\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 81  \nIEA.

The scope of the proposed regulation includes \nsmaller trucks, city buses, long-distance buses, and trailers, to cover 95% of \nsectoral emissions, up from about 70% currently. This demonstrates a step-up in \nambition: the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) estimates that \nthe new regulations could achieve sectoral  emissions reduction of over 75% by \n2050 relative to 2020.  \nThe revisions would increase targets for CO 2 emissions reductions to 45% by \n2030 relative to 2019, 65% by 2035, and 90% by 2040. Furthermore, all city buses \nshould be ZEVs by 2030. Compliance will be measured separately for passenger \n(bus and coach) and freight vehicles via a system of credits and debts settled at \nthe end of five-year periods between 2025 and 2040. Additionally, the definition of \nZEV applied is changing, increasing from 1 gCO2 per vehicle-km to \n5 gCO2 per tonne-km (tkm) to allow for dual fuel. Trading between economically \nlinked entities (e.g. between brands at the same parent company) is allowed to \nhelp meet targets. The minimum range of long- haul trucks is defined as 350 km, \nand financial penalties are applied for non-compliance.  \nSeveral European Union member countries are strengthening support for zero-\nemission heavy transport in national plans. Germany has among the highest truck \npurchase subsidies in Europe, with 80% of additional costs of the vehicle and/or \nthe charging infrastructure covered. Ireland\u2019s updated Climate Action Plan \nincludes a target of 700 low -emission heavy -duty trucks by 2025, a 30% zero-\nemission heavy-duty truck sales share by 2030, and provisions for HDVs. Ireland \nalso introduced its first electric bus target: 300 by 2025. In Denmark, from 2025 \nonwards, taxes on trucks will be based on CO 2 emissions, sending a clear policy \nsignal to operators. In April 2022, Italy made subsidies available for trucks \nbetween 3.5 and 12 t, and in the same month, the Netherlands introduced a wide-\nranging scheme covering vehicles from small trucks up to tractor units \n(4.25-18+ t). Croatia implemented a scheme with a similarly wide scope in June. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 82  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nIn total, ten European countries now also have a subsidy scheme for HDVs, five \nof which were introduced in 2022/23. \nIncreasing inclusion of HDVs in targets and policy \nincentives  \nIn the United States, the IRA provides USD 1 billion for vehicles and infrastructure \nspecifically for HDVs, including subsidies, and the state of California\u2019s funding \npackage for charging infrastructure will see 70% of funds dedicated to charging \nfor HDVs. In the United Kingdom, HDVs remain included in subsidy schemes even \nthough support for electric cars has been phased out. Similarly, Australia\u2019s subsidy \nscheme under the Future Fuels Program specifically targets HDVs and HDV \ncharging with dedicated funding that is not available for LDVs. \nSeveral countries have specific targets for zero- or low-emission heavy transport. \nIn New Zealand, the aim is to reduce emissions from freight transport by 35% by \n2035. Norway aims for virtually zero-emission goods distribution by 2030 in the \nbiggest urban centres. Tianjin (China), aims to have 80% NEVs in public transport, \nrental, logistics and delivery vehicle sales by 2025, while Viet Nam \u2019s net zero \ntransport by 2050 goal includes HDVs. Japan aims to introduce 5 000 electric \nHDVs by 2030, with a JPY 13.6 billion (USD 120 million) plan to electrify HDVs \nand taxis. Some countries are also introducing financial support for electric truck \npurchases for the first time. In July 2022, Canada\u2019s Incentives for Medium - and \nHeavy-duty Zero-Emission Vehicles  (iMHZEV ) programme began to offer \nincentives up to CAD  (Canadian dollars) 200 000 (USD 160 000) towards the \npurchase or lease of ZEV trucks of various categories.  \nWith respect to electric buses, overall model availability  is higher and cost-\ncompetitiveness better  than trucks, making them generally more affordable. \nIndeed, several EMDEs  have begun including ambitious deployment targets for \nelectric buses in national plans, often ahead of LDV targets. For example, in April \n2022, Panama announced the aim of transitioning towards electric  public \ntransport, reaching a 10% share by 2025, 20% by 2027, and 33% by 2030. In \nFebruary 2023, Tamil N\u0101du in India also introduced a target for 30% of their bus \nfleet to be electric by 2030 as part of a broad strategy to promote EVs and \nsupporting infrastructure. In advanced economies, grants for electric buses have \nbeen introduced in Canada. The United States also provides substantial funding \ntowards the purchasing or leasing of electric  buses: up to 85% of vehicle costs  \nand up to 90% of infrastructure costs. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 83  \nIEA.

Grey sections \nindicate that a country does not have policy or commitment addressing this specific area. HDV targets are separated as it is \ncommon for countries to have explicit targets for one category and not both. A country is considered to have infrastructure \npolicy only where HDV charging is explicitly mentioned. Similarly, \u201ctruck targets\u201d refers to explicit targets for either vehicle \nsales/stock volumes or shares.  \nCountries are supporting deployment of electric trucks and buses, from less firm \ncommitments such as signing pledges, all the way to funding dedicated charging \ninfrastructure.  \nPolicy support for EV charging infrastructure  \nSupport is gradually shifting from vehicles to charging in \nsome markets \nIn countries where electromobility is more well developed, focus is shifting towards \nsupporting charging infrastructure and moving away from more expensive private \nvehicle subsidisation. In the United Kingdom , for example, in June 2022 the \ngovernment announced its intention to refocus on charging , after winding down \nthe electric  car subsidy programme. Almost GBP 1.6 billion (USD  2.1 billion) of \ngovernment funding has been committed to supporting the EV Infrastructure \nStrategy, which set an expectation of 300 000 public chargers being installed by \n2030. The UK government is also working to increase the availability of on-street \nchargers, particularly in residential areas where off-street parking is not available.  \nNorway\n(10.7%)\nFinland\n(7.8%)\nDenmark\n(7.1%)\nChina\n(6.5%)\nUnited Kingdom\n(2.7%)\nFrance\n(2.5%)\nChile\n(2.5%)Austria\n(2.0%)\nGermany \n(1.8%)\nNetherlands\n(1.6%)\nNew Zealand\n(1.4%)\nCanada\n(1.1%)\nUnited States\n(0.6%)\nItaly\n(0.5%)\nJapan\n(0.0%)\nGlobal MoU Bus targets Truck targets Financial incentives Infrastructure support\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 84  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nWith charging identified as the top consideration for consumers in China, \nGuangdong, Hunan and Shanghai, among other  regions, have implemented \nsubsidies for the deployment of charging points. Shenzhen is targeting 43 000 fast \nchargers and 790 000 slow chargers by  2025, and Chongqing 240 000 chargers.  \nGermany, which is also winding down its vehicle subsidy scheme, has at the same \ntime supplemented the budget for fast chargers . In Switzerland, the gov ernment \nextended its Electromobility Roadmap in 2022, with the goal of achieving 20 000 \npublic charging stations by 2025 to support the 50% EV sales share target. Having \nlaunched a vehicle subsidy scheme in 2021, Poland i s now also subsiding \ncharging infrastructure. Finland and  Denmark hav e recently committed to greater \nsupport of charger roll-out, as has Ireland, which released a revised ZEV plan that \nfocuses on public charging. \nAdditional support for charging infrastructure aims to \nservice different road transport segments in more \nsettings \nSome countries are choosing to fund infrastructure development in advance of \nlarge-scale adoption of EVs. One notable example is Australia, which has had \ngrants to fund charging prior to 2020 and a dedicated infrastructure funding \nprogramme s ince 2020, and began to provide support for electric HDVs in 2022, \nin conjunction with charging. 15 The first period of Viet N am\u2019s strategy  i ncludes \nbuilding a charging network, without a focus on subsidising vehicles. Similarly, \nBulgaria\u2019s efforts to promote EVs are starting with charging. In Indi a, targets and \nincentives are being developed at the state level to supplement national ambitions, \nwith the Tamil N\u0101du government set to subsidise the installation of 750 chargers. \nUnder the Green Growth Strategy, Japan pl ans to construct 150 000 publicly \naccessible charging stations by 2030: 30 000 of which will be fast charging.  \nIn the United States, more than USD 1.5  billion has  been approved under the \nNational Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program  to help build EV \nchargers covering approximately 75 000 miles of highway across the country . \nNational s tandards  to qu alify for the funding were adopted in 2023 with the aim of \ncreating a convenient, affordable, reliable, and equitable network of char gers \nthroughout the country. These standards will harmonise payments and pricing \ninformation for charging, and aim to ensure minimum numbers and types of \nchargers, including fast charging, to support achievement of the target of installing \n500 000 chargers no more than 80 km apart along major routes by 2030 . In  \naddition, under the IRA, as of January 2023, vehicle charging infrastructure \ninstallations are eligible for a tax credit of up to USD 100  000, and consumers who \n15 This funding specifically excludes private vehicles and cannot be used to fund direct costs for LDVs.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 85  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \npurchase a home charger can receive a tax credit of up to USD 1 000. California, \noften a front-runner in EV policy development, committed additional funding of \nUSD 1 billion of funding  to charging infrastructure in November 2022. Both at a \nnational level and under California\u2019s funding scheme, there is financial support to \nbuild out medium- and heavy-duty truck charging stations.  \nCanada recently increased funding available through the Ze ro Emission Vehicle \nInfrastructure Program  by an additional CAD  400  million (USD  310 million) to \nextend the programme through March 2027. The programme supports the \ndeployment of public and private chargers, including at multi-unit residential \nbuildings and workplaces, as well as funding strategic infrastructure projects for \nurban delivery and fleet applications. Furthermore, the Canada Infrastructure \nBank announced in 2022 that it will invest CAD  500  million (USD 385 million) in \nlarge-scale charging infrastructure. This is all to support the government\u2019s target \nof 84 500 chargers deployed by 2029.  \nIn 2021, the European Commission proposed t he Alternative Fuels Infrastructure \nRegulation (AFIR) in place of the 2014 Directive. A s of March 2023, the European \nCouncil and European Parliament have a provisional agreement  for  the AFIR, \nwhich includes requirements for total power capacity based on the size of the light \nEV fleet, and coverage requirements for the trans -European network -transport \n(TEN-T) with respect to light- and heavy-duty vehicles. An a greement  betw een the \nEuropean Investment Bank and the European Commission will make over \nEUR 1.5 billion available by the end of 2023 for alternative fuels infrastructure, \nincluding for EV charging. Grants to support EVSE deployment are also available \nfrom the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for Transport programme. \nPolicy incentives for battery swapping in China and India \nBattery swapping policies are gaining popularity , as the technology offers  a \npotential solution to concerns about range, charging times, and upfront costs \nfaced by EV owners. The two countries most actively pursuing battery swapping \nare China and India. In China, battery swapping is being used for passenger cars \nand more recently  has also been used for  trucks. In India, battery swapping \nfocuses on two- and three-wheelers and is most often proposed for the e-\ncommerce and hyper -local delivery services sector in which variable routes and \nhigh daily mileages are a concern. However, widespread implementation is still \nhindered by high start-up costs and a lack of standardisation.  \nThe first Chinese standard was published in 2021, and later that year 11 cities \nwere chosen for technology demonstration pilots, with the goal of refining the \nstandards, b ut this has not yet been completed . The r elevance of battery swapping \nin China is further evidenced by its inclusion in the national strategy for the NEV \nindustry. C ities and provinces such as Shanghai , Beijing and Chongqing a lso \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 86  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nprovide financial support for battery swapping, often as a part of their NEV \npromotion plans or subsidy schemes for charging infrastructure. Chongqing , for \nexample, aims to build over 200 battery swapping stations and deploy more than \n10 000 battery swapping-enabled EVs by 2023, while Beijing aims to have 310 by \n2025. At the end of 2022, China had almost 2 000 battery swapping stations.  \nIn order to promote battery swapping, India first amended the demand incentive \nscheme (FAME II) to allow the sale of vehicles and batteries separately to electric \ntwo- and three-wheelers , with the aim of reducing upfront costs. However, this \nresulted in ambiguity around subsidy disbursement and eligibility, and incidentally \nincreased the applicable tax rate. To resolve these issues, in 2022 India \nannounced a draft battery swapping policy  that stipulates the minimum technical \nand operational requirements, as well as clarifications on financial issues. A \nnumber of state governments in India have also announced support for battery \nswapping. For example, the Delhi government stipulates an even distribution of \nsubsidy between the vehicle owner and energy operator and an allocation of land \nfor the establishment of swap points with favourable conditions. Other states are \nproviding up to 25% capital subsidy for stations that meet certain eligibility criteria. \nThe national government envisages the roll -out of the swapping stations  in two \nphases. In Phase 1, all metropolitan cities with a population of more than 4 million \nwill be prioritis ed, followed by Tier -II cities (with a population greater than \n0.5 million) in Phase 2.   \nA multiplying number of international \ninitiatives and pledges \nThe number of multilateral initiatives and pledges focusing on electromobility has \nincreased rapidly in the last decade. This reflects government appetite around the \nworld to accelerate the transition to zero- emission transport, and is an \nencouraging sign that international collaboration has a strong role to play in global \ndecarbonisation. The multiplication of multilateral initiatives is a phenomenon also \nobserved in other segments of the clean energy sector, such as hydrogen and \nrenewables. To increase the impact of such initiatives, it is important for member \ncountries to ensure that the schemes complement each other and to identify where \nspecifically in the EV value chain they should focus. \nAccelerating to Zero  \nThe overarching goal of the Accelerating to Zero  (A2Z) coalition launched at the \nConference of the Parties (COP 27) is for all sales of new cars and vans globally \nto be ZEVs by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets. The coalition \nbuilds on the Zero-Emission Vehicles Declaration, which received some \n130 signatures on launch at COP26, and now has 223 signatories. These include \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nIEA.

The 40 governments together \naccounted for almost a quarter of annual LDV sales worldwide, and close to 20% \nof electric LDV sales in 2022. Some subnational government or non-governmental \nsignatories have also set specific, more ambitious goals, such as regional or city \nauthorities and fleet owners and operators aiming to electrify their fleets by as \nearly as 2030. \nZero-Emission Government Fleet Declaration \nIn 2022, recognising the catalytic role that national governments can have via \ndemand signals and leadership, a group of nine countries18 committed to the Zero-\nEmission Government Fleet Declaration. They aim to r each 100% zero-emission \ncars and vans  in government fleets, with an additional aspiration of 100% zero -\nemission trucks and buses, by no later than 2035. Exact timelines vary by country. \nFor example, 75% and 100% of acquisitions should be electric by 2025 in \nAustralia 19  and Israel, respectively ; 100% of acquisitions  by 2027 in the \nUnited States; and 100% of the LDV stock should be zero-emission by 2030 in \nCanada.  \nZero-emission Vehicle Emerging Markets Initiative \nIn 2022, at COP27, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development \n(WBCSD), the United States and the United Kingdom launched the Zero-Emission \nVehicle Emerging Markets Initiative . It aims to enhance co-operation between \npublic and private actors in EMDEs to accelerate the transition to zero-emission \nroad transport. Specifically, the initiative opened a dialogue between governments \nand corporates on public support and private investment to achieve ZEV \ndeployment targets in EMDEs, with the view to facilitate and announce \nagreements at COP28. It gathers companies that have announced a combined \nUSD 50 billion in investment and committed to deploy over 2 million EVs in \nEMDEs by 2030. In February 2023, the first dialogue of the series took place in \nIndia, launching a country pilot programme there. \n16 Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Cabo Verde, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, El Salvador, Finland, France, \nGreece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway , Poland, \nSlovenia, Spain, Sweden, the Holy See, and the United Kingdom.  \n17 Armenia, Dominican Republic, Ghana, India, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco, Paraguay, Rwanda, T\u00fcrkiye, and Ukraine.  \n18 Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. \n19 Includes leases. \nPAGE | 87  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 88  \nIEA.

In \n2022, Aruba, Belgium, Croatia, Cura\u00e7ao, Dominican Republic, Ireland, \nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Sint Maarten, Ukraine, and the United States all signed \nthe MoU. This brings the total number of countries and territories  among the \nsignatories to 27,20 accounting for over 15% of total annual sales of new medium- \nand heavy -duty vehicles worldwide. The MoU also has endorsements from \nregional government, manufacturing, fleet owners and operators, among others.  \nGreening Corporate Fleets \nThe European Commission committed to promote commercial use of zero-\nemission vehicles through a Greening Corporate Fleets  initiative in 2023. In an \nopen letter to the Commission shared by Transport & Environment, a campaign \ngroup, 30 private and state-owned companies, as well as industry groups, called \nfor the Commission\u2019s initiative to include a binding target that by 2030 all new \ncorporate LDVs should be ZEVs. The companies include fleet owners and \noperators and EV infrastructure developers.  \nThe letter was also signed by the EV100 campaign , which itself now has 130 \nmember companies. EV100 aims by 2030 to switch all fleet vehicles under 7.5 t \nto EVs and to install charging infrastructure for employees and customers. In total, \nEV100 members have now committed to electrify nearly 725 000 vehicles in their \nown fleets, and over 5 million leased vehicles.  \nEV100+  \nThe EV100+ campaign  was launched in 2022 by the Climate Group, the \noriginators of the EV100 aimed at LDVs. Signatories of the EV100+ campaign \ncommit to transition their fleet of vehicles over 7.5 t to zero-emission by 2040 in \nOECD markets, China and India. Founding members include a few corporate fleet \nowners or users. \nRecent actions included setting up a broader  coalition of truck makers, transport \noperators, shippers and retailers, energy providers  and infrastructure operators \nand calling for ambitious targets in the (then upcoming) EU HDV CO2 regulations,  \n \n \n20 Previous signatories are Austria, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, \nPortugal, Scotland, Switzerland, T\u00fcrkiye, United Kingdom, Uruguay, and Wales.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 89  \nIEA.

EV100+ also signed a similar open letter  by Transport & \nEnvironment, demonstrating their alignment on the issue. \nElectrification plans by original equipment \nmanufacturers (OEMs)  \nVoluntary announcements of EV targets have become in creasingly common \nacross the automotive industry. Targets may be formulated in terms of total sales \nvolumes, as sales shares, or as an ambition to transition all sales of the company \nor of a certain brand to all -electric. As shown in Prospects for electric vehicle \ndeployment, these targets often exceed not only  r egulatory requirements (as \nreflected in the Stated Policies Scenario), but also government ambitions (as \nreflected in the Announced Pledges Scenario). \nHowever, manufacturers\u2019 targets are non-binding and still often focus only on \nleading EV markets. Indeed, it is probably no coincidence that the most ambitious \ntargets are for the European market, where the newly amended CO 2 emission \nstandards would mean that all new cars and vans will be zero-emission by 2035. \nMajor new OEM announcements have been made at the global level and \nregionally in 2022-2023. Several Chinese OEMs recently announced EV targets; \nin contrast with OEMs based in the rest of the world, Chinese car manufacturers\u2019 \ntargets are generally shorter-term and tend to be well within reach of current NEV \nmarket shares.  \nIn addition, automakers continue to invest increasing sums in electrification and \ndigital technologies. Just s even automakers, which were collectively responsible \nfor nearly half of LDV  sales in 2022, have capital expenditures of more than  \nUSD 55 billion on emerging automotive technologies  since 2019, including for \nmanufacturing facilities.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 90  \nIEA.

Most of this was directly spent by consumers when buying \na vehicle, while governments spent around USD 40 billion through direct purchase \nincentives. These include subsidies and tax deductions such as VAT exemption, \nand bonuses related to weight, CO 2 emissions or range. The increase in global \nspending on electric cars means that carmakers \u2013 including incumbents \u2013 are \ngenerating more revenues from EV sales, and particularly from SUVs and large \ncar models, thereby progressively helping to reduce reliance on ICE sales to \nfinance EV manufacturing, R&D and new model development. While there is still \na long way to go, this is an important step for EV growth and the transition to fully \nelectrified road transport. \n-100\n-80\n-60\n-40\n-20\n0\n2010 2020 2030 2040 2050\n%\nRenault \nGroup\nBMW Group\nNissan\nHonda\nMazda\nToyota\nFord\nVW GroupHyundai\nGeely\nGeneral Motors\nVolvo cars\nMercedes-Benz\nStellantis\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 94  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nOver the 2017-2022 period, the share of government spending in total spending \ndecreased from over 20% to just under 10%. On a per-vehicle basis, government \nspending decreased from around USD 9 000 per electric car in 2017 to USD 4 000 \nin 2022, as sales increased more quickly than government spending. In 2023 and \nbeyond, governments in major EV markets are gradually phasing out subsidies for \nelectric cars, suggesting government spending will decrease in those markets. \nHowever, incentives in markets where adoption has been lower to date, including \nin EMDEs such as India, Indonesia and Thailand, could push overall government \nspending up. \nIn both China and Europe, government spending has increased significantly since \n2017, especially in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In China, government \nspending dipped in 2019-2020 but caught up quickly afterwards: it doubled \nbetween 2020 and 2021, and increased by nearly 70% in 2022 relative to 2021, \nexceeding USD 22 billion. In Europe, government spending boomed in 2020 and \ncontinued increasing through 2021 (up 50% year -on-year) and 2022 (up 20%), \ntotalling more than USD  15 billion in 2022. In China, purchase incenti ves, which \nare based on driving range, have been decreasing. Although the average range \nof electric cars sold in China has been increasing, and accordingly more models \nhave become eligible for subsidies, per-unit government support has been steadily \ndecreasing, standing at around USD 4 000 in 2022. The majority of public support \nfor electric cars comes from the vehicle purchase tax exemption rather than the \nsubsidy. In Europe, per -unit support by governments has remained steady at \naround USD 6 000 over the 2017-2022 period, but could drop in 2023 and future \nyears as subsidies decrease in major markets such as Germany, the United \nKingdom and France.  \nMeanwhile, federal government spending in the United States has remained much \nlower than that in other major markets in the past few years, especially as major \ncarmakers \u2013 mostly Tesla and General Motors \u2013 reached the cap on further \nsubsidies. However, it increased from below USD  1 billion in 2020 to almost \nUSD 2.5 billion in 2022 as more electric cars that are eligible to subsidies were \nsold than in previous years. While aggregate public support increased \nsignificantly, the IRA changed eligibility requirements for sales taking place \nbetween mid-August and end-2022. The IRA aims to promote EV manufacturing \nin North America, and as such the list of vehicles qualifying for s ubsidies shrank \nin the second half of 2022. Furthermore, while carmaker caps have been removed \nin 2023, they remained in place throughout 2022 . As a result, public spending on \na per-unit basis dropped from more than USD 3 000 in 2021 to USD 2 500 in 2022. \nThe trend could be reversed in 2023 and beyond as the list of qualifying vehicles \ngrows.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 95  \nIEA.

This drop is almost entirely due to Tesla: the \ncompany\u2019s market capitalisation decreased from its peak at the end of 2021 to \nearly 2023 by about USD 870 billion, which is more than the combined valuation \nof the selected top 10 incumbent carmakers early 2023. The company also heavily \nreduced vehicle prices repeatedly i n 2023 to boost sales, with discounts of up to \nUSD 34 000. However, Tesla remains the highest valued EV firm  and the eighth \nmost highly valued company in the world, with strong i nvestor confidence.

BYD overtook Tesla \nin terms of sales, while competition remains fierce among incumbent automakers. \nIncreasing competition in EV markets is also influencing investor confidence and \nfinancial performance. Incumbent carmakers  are diversifying their fleets in order \nto comply with strengthened policies, such as CO 2 standards, or to reach new \nconsumers, yet are struggling to catch up with EV companies. New market \nentrants \u2013 especially from China \u2013 that aim to capture a share of booming EV \nmarkets are also increasing pressure on incumbent carmakers. Carmakers that \ndo not have sufficiently attractive electric car offerings are likely to face i ssues in \nthe growing EV market in the near future. \nIn 2022, the w orld\u2019s largest carmakers in terms of ICE car sales (Volkswagen, \nGeneral Motors, Toyota, Stellantis, Honda, Renault-Nissan -Mitsubishi, Ford, \nHyundai-Kia, Geely, Mercedes -Benz and BMW) accounted for 40% of global \nelectric car sales. In 2015, the same companies accounted for 55%. Over the \nsame period, the combined market share of just two companies, Tesla and BYD, \nincreased from 20% to over 30%.

Incumbent \nChinese carmakers are also adapting their strategies, such as Great Wall Motor , \nwhich in March 2023 announced a new strategy focusing on EVs, after sales \ndropped in 2022 by nearly 20% relative to 2021. \nFigure 2.11. Gross margin of selected companies, 2015-2023 \n \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: Gross margin refers to gross profits as a share of revenues.

On average, Tesla \nhas been outperforming incumbent automakers. \nCompanies seek value upstream in batteries and critical \nminerals \nAs battery demand continues to increase, battery makers are seeing strong financial \nstock performance, outperforming that of EV makers in 2022, in spite of supply chain \ndisruptions and critical mineral price volatility. Their market capitalisation has also \nbeen steadily increasing since 2020, suggesting strong investor confidence in future \nreturns and growth. In 2022, CATL, which accounts for nearly 40% of the world\u2019s \nmarket for EV cells, far ahead of LG Energy and BYD, saw net income nearly double \nrelative to 2021 as EV sales increased. Financial analysts suggest that the market \nfor lithium-ion batteries could boom from USD 90 billion in 2022 to USD 250 billion \nin 2030. \nHowever, growth in market capitalisation was slower and financial performance not \nas high in 2022 as it was over 2020-2021.

This is due not only to increasing competition in the market, but also to higher \nraw material and commodity prices (e.g. for lithium, cobalt and nickel), which tend \nto boost the profits of firms involved in extraction while putting pressure on the firms \npurchasing the materials for refining and to manufacture products such as batteries. \nAs carmakers compete to secure battery supplies, they are increasing investments \nfor in-house battery production for increased vertical integration. For example, Tesla \nis increasing its focus on battery manufacturing, and introducing innovative \nconcepts expected to cut costs. Toyota, GM, Hyundai and Ford are investing  \nUSD 2.5 billion, USD 6.6 billion, USD 5.5 billion and USD 11.4 billion respectively in \nEV and battery manufacturing sites in the United States alone. To secure supply of \ncritical minerals needed for batteries, carmakers are also partnering w ith mining \ncompanies or even directly investing in mining operations. Ford partnered with Vale \nand Huayou to build a processing plant in Indonesia with capacity to process 120 kt \nof nickel per year; Stellantis invested EUR  50 million (USD  55 million) in the \nGerman lithium producer Vulcan, and Tesla signed agreements with mining \ncompanies such as Albemarle, for lithium, and Prony Resources, for nickel. \nFigure 2.12. Key financial indicators of top mining companies, 2016-2022 \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: Top 100 mining refers to companies with the highest market capitalisation in 2022 and with a share of revenues \nfrom mining of more than 70% of total revenues.

In 2021, the \ncombined value of critical minerals used for clean technologies was around \nUSD 75 billion. Assuming prices stay constant, by 2050, the needs of the energy \ntransition could increase this value fivefold in the Net Zero by 2050 Scenario. This \nprospect makes the critical mineral sector especially attractive for investors. \nIndeed, the market capitalisation of lithium, copper and nickel mining companies \ngrew by 350%, 90% and 85% respectively  between 2016 and 2022, compared \nwith 20% for coal producers and 75% for the top 100 mining companies over the \nsame period. This reflects increasing appetite for critical metal mining and \nconfidence in future returns. There are also new entrants in this sector, just as in \nother steps of the EV supply chain. In March 2023, Lithium Royalty Corp., a \nCanadian company established in 2018, raised USD 109 million in the biggest \ninitial public offering (IPO) in the country since May 2022.  \nCompetition is pushing some mining companies to also seek vertical integration: \ndownstream in mineral processing for miners, and upstream in mining for refiners. \nAlbemarle and Covalent Lithium, for example, are building  processing sites in \nAustralia to turn the spodumene they extract into lithium hydroxide. In total, lithium \nprocessing projects have received USD  5 billion in Western Australia alone over \nthe past three years. As a result of mining companies expanding operations \ndownstream, refiners are under pressure, with profit margins shrinking, especially \nin China where there is historic reliance on Australian spodumene. As a result, \nsome refiners are moving upstream as a means to secure raw materials, but lead \ntimes to develop new mines can be long. \nLooking to the future, vertical integration on both sides of EV supply chains \u2013 from \nminers downstream and from carmakers upstream \u2013 could help decrease \nmanufacturing costs and prices for consumers accordingly, but could also lead to \ngreater market concentration. \nVenture capital investments in EV start-ups \nIn the p ast decade, venture capital (VC) funding for clean energy start-ups has \nboomed, particularly in electromobility. Financial investors such as banks and VC \nor private equity funds see in EV start-ups a potential for future returns with high \nexit values. Many companies, including major incumbent carmakers, also provide \nfunding to start-ups through corporate VC to develop new technology or to acquire \nconcepts developed by new entrants, as a means to maintain a competitive edge \nand secure their own positioning in car markets. While in the past century most \nmajor carmakers typically developed ICE technology in-house, through R&D and \nmanufacturing innovation, investing in start-ups is now a notable trend, illustrating \na new way of innovating, and the need to catch up with quickly evolving markets \nand regulatory environments. \nIn 2022, VC investments in early-stage start-ups (i.e. seed and series A, referring \nto the first rounds of financing and the earlier stages of start-up development) \ndeveloping battery technologies increased by 15% relative to 2021 to nearly \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 101  \nIEA.

The increase was particularly \nhigh in the charging segment, which saw an all -time high among early -stage \nfunding at USD 730 million. There was also a notable increase in funding for \nbattery recycling and reuse, which stood at USD 200 million, an eightfold increase \nrelative to 2021.  \nFigure 2.13.

Star t-ups developing new electric cars were the first \nbeneficiaries of booming EV VC in around 2015, but less and less capital is \nprovided to new entrants as competition increases and major incumbents \naccelerate electrification. The 2015-2020 period also saw major VC activity in \nChina, but this has now declined as the market consolidates around frontrunners \n\u2013 many of which were start-ups less than a decade ago.  \nEarly-stage investors are instead looking for new investment opportunities in the \nvalue chain, either upstream (such as batteries or critical minerals) or downstream \n(such as charging or recycling). Companies developing lithium -ion batteries still \ndominate, accounting for 60% of early -stage VC investments in the battery \nsegment over 2018-2022, but new chemistries are on the rise, both lithium - and \nnon-lithium-based. Critical minerals VC is also booming as metal demand surges, \nstanding at around USD  650 million in 2022 from close to zero in 2018-2019, \nbefore the Covid-19 pandemic. \nFigure 2.14.

As such, \nthe downward trend in 2022 might not be of immediate concern. For trucks, the \n2019-2021 period was a fruitful one in growth equity VC markets, but investor \nappetite may be drying up following concerns over the performance of leading \ncompanies. \nOver the 2018-2022 period, China accounted for 70% of VC investments in electric \ncar start-ups, while the United States led in investments in charging, trucks and \nbattery components. Funding for battery making start-ups was evenly distributed \nacross China, Europe and the United States. India had a strong lead in two-\nwheelers, the only EMDE beyond China with a significant presence in global EV \nVC. \nFigure 2.15.

In 2022, the share of global battery \nmanufacturing capacity located in China was around 75%. \nFigure 2.16.

The share of electric car exports from \nthe United States peaked in 2019 and has since fallen below the levels exported \nfrom China, Korea and Europe. While the number of electric cars traded globally \nhas continued to increase over time, the share of exports out of total electric car \nsales has decreased over the past four years.  \nThe transition to electric mobility is shifting and will continue to shift trade \nbalances. Historically, Europe has been a net exporter of ICE cars (by value), \nwhile China has been a net importer. However, with the transition to electric cars, \nthe size of the ICE car market is expected to shrink over time, while the EV market \ngrows. China, Japan and Korea are all net exporters of electric cars, electric \nmotors and Li -ion batteries , and are well positioned to benefit from a growing \nelectric car market. Nonetheless, these battery -exporting countries are also \nstrongly dependent on the import of critical minerals, such as lithium, cobalt and \nnickel. \n0\n 100\n 200\n 300\n 400\n 500\n2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022\nChina Korea United States Japan Other\nThousand vehicles\nLocation of EV production for export to Europe\nKorea\nJapan\nChina\nUnited States\nEurope\nCarmaker \nheadquarters\nbased in:\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 106  \nIEA.

CC BY 4.0. \nProspects for electric vehicle \ndeployment \nSeveral pathways to electrify road transport in the period to 2030 are explored in \nthis section. First, deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) is projected by region and \nroad segment for the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges scenarios, and \nglobally by segment for the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. These \nprojections are then compared to announcements by original equipment \nmanufacturers (OEMs). Then the corresponding battery demand is projected, \nfollowed by roll-out requirements for charging infrastructure. Finally, the impacts \nof EV deployment are assessed, including increased electricity demand, oil \ndisplacement, implications for  tax revenues, and net well -to-wheels GHG \nemissions. \nOutlook for electric mobility \nScenarios \nA scenario-based approach is used to explore road transport electrification and its \nimpact, based on the latest market data, policy drivers and technology \nperspectives. Two IEA scenarios \u2013 the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges \nscenarios \u2013 inform the outlooks, which are examined in relation to the Net Zero \nEmissions by 2050 Scenario at the global level .1 These scenarios are based on \nannounced policies, ambitions and market trends through the first quarter of 2023. \nThe purpose of the scenarios is to assess plausible futures for global EV markets \nand the implications they could have. The scenarios do not make predictions about \nthe future. Rather, they aim to provide insights to inform decision-making by \ngovernments, companies and stakeholders about the future of EVs. \nThese scenario projections incorporate GDP and population assumptions from the \nInternational Monetary Fund (2022) and United Nations ( 202 2), respectively.  \nStated Policies Scenario \nThe Stated Policies Scenario ( STEPS) reflects existing policies and measures, as \nwell as firm policy ambitions and objectives  that have been legislated by \n1 The projections in the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges scenarios are based on historical trends through the end of \n2022 as well as stated policies and ambitions as of the end of March 2023. The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario is \nconsistent with the World Energy Outlook 2022 publication.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 108  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \ngovernments around the world. It includes current EV-related policies, regulations \nand investments, as well as  market trends  based on the expected impacts of \ntechnology developments, announced deployments and plans from industry \nstakeholders. The STEPS aims to hold up a mirror to the plans of policy makers \nand illustrate their consequences. \nAnnounced Pledges Scenario \nThe Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) assumes that all announced ambitions \nand targets made by governments around the world are met in full and on time. \nWith regards to electromobility, it includes all recent major announcements of \nelectrification targets and longer-term net zero emissions and other pledges, \nregardless of whether  these have been anchored in legislation or in updated \nNationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). For example, the APS assumes that \ncountries that have signed on to the Conference of the Parties (COP  26) \ndeclaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emissions cars and vans  \nwill achieve this goal , even if there are not yet policies or regulations in place to \nsupport it. In countries that have not yet made a net zero emissions pledge or set \nelectrification targets, the APS considers the same policy framework as the \nSTEPS. Non-policy assumptions for the APS, including population and economic \ngrowth, are the same as in the STEPS. \nThe difference between the APS and the STEPS represents the \u201cimplementation \ngap\u201d that exists between the policy frameworks and measures required to achieve \ncountry ambitions and targets, and the policies and measures that have been \nlegislated. \nNet Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario \nThe Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) is a normative scenario \nthat sets out a narrow but achievable pathway for the global energy sector to \nachieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The scenario is compatible with limiting \nthe global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited temperature overshoot, in \nline with reductions assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nin its Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C. There are many possible paths \nto achieve net zero CO 2 emissions globally by 2050 and many uncertainties that \ncould affect them. The NZE Scenario is therefore a path and not the path to net \nzero emissions. \nThe difference between the NZE Scenario and the APS highlights the \u201cambition \ngap\u201d that needs to be closed to achieve the goals under the 2015 Paris \nAgreement. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 109  \nIEA.

In this scenario, EVs \naccount for over 10% of the road vehicle fleet by 2030. Total EV sales reach over \n20 million in 2025 and over 40 million in 2030, representing over 20% and 30% of \nall vehicle sales, respectively.  \nFigure 3.1.

CC BY 4.0. \nBox 3.1 Closing the implementation gap: how EV policy is catching up \nwith targets \nTargets and ambitions for clean energy technology deployment are generally more \neasily formulated than they are achieved, but in the case of EVs, the momentum \nis clearly on the side of achievement. Strong market uptake in 2022, combined \nwith major policy announcements over the past year, have led to a significant \nupward revision of EV deployment to 2030 in the STEPS presented in this edition \nof the Global EV Outlook compared to the 2022 edition. The projected sales shares \nof EVs based on stated policies and market trends are now coming close to country \nstated ambitions for EVs, meaning that the policy implementation gap \u2013 the \ndifference between country deployment ambitions and the policies currently in \nplace \u2013 in the 2023 Outlook is much smaller than in the 2022 edition. \nThis is most notable for light-duty vehicles, where recent policies such as the US \nInflation Reduction Act (IRA) and new EU CO 2 standards for cars and vans have \nresulted in a significantly higher EV sales share in 2030 in the STEPS. In this year\u2019s \nOutlook, under announced ambitions, the electric car sales share exceeds 40% in \n2030 compared to 35% under stated policies: this gap has more than halved in the \npast year. For trucks and buses, the EV sales share in 2030 in the STEPS also \nincreased faster than ambition. As a result, the gap between ambition and \nlegislated policies for HDVs is half of what it was in the 2022 Outlook. \nElectric car sales share implementation gap, 2030 \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nRealising the potential of EVs to support government climate (as wel l as energy \nsecurity) ambitions is thus almost in reach under current policy frameworks. In \nparticular, the gap between policy and ambition has closed in three of the largest \nEV markets: the European Union, the United States and China. At the global level, \noil displacement by EVs reaches 1.8 million barrels per day in 2025 (over 5 mb/d \nin 2030) under stated policies. As a result, global demand for oil-based road \ntransport fuels will peak by 2025. \n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\n40%\n45%\n2030 STEPS Implementation\ngap\n2030 APS 2030 STEPS Implementation\ngap\n2030 APS\n2022 Outlook 2023 Outlook\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 112  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nThe momentum seen over the past year in terms of increasing E V sales and new \nsupportive policies being introduced, along with funding designated for the \nnecessary infrastructure (for example, the USD 5 billion allocated in the US IIJA to \nsupport EV charger installation), have also led industry players to invest more in \nEV supply chains. Notably, planned EV battery manufacturing expansions are set \nto increase capacity more than fourfold, reaching 6.8 TWh/year of production \ncapacity in 2030, 65% higher than is needed to enable the level of EV deployment \nin the APS. Taken together, this suggests that even higher EV deployment than is \nimplied by the APS is achievable by 2030 if policy efforts are sustained and critical \npotential bottlenecks (such as around recharging infrastructure and mining) are \naddressed early on. \nLight-duty vehicles \nLight-duty vehicles (LDVs), including passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) and \nlight commercial vehicles (LCVs), continue to make up the majority of electric \nvehicles (excluding two/three-wheelers). This is a result of strong policy support, \nincluding light-duty vehicle fuel economy or CO 2 standards, the availability of EV \nmodels, and the size of the LDV market. In the STEPS, electric LDV sales are \nprojected to reach over 20 million in 2025, doubling the number of sales in 2022, \nand to quadruple to 40 million in 2030. The sales share of electric LDVs thus \nincreases from 13% in 2022 to over 20% in 2025 and around 35% in 2030. The \nstock of electric LDVs reaches about 230 million in 2030, meaning that about one \nin every seven LDVs on the road is electric.  \nIn the APS, the fleet of electric LDVs  reaches over 240 million in 2030, a 15% \nstock share. Of these, 230 million are electric PLDVs, with only 6% being LCVs. \nSales of electric LDVs reach almost 45 million in 2030 in the APS, representing a \nsales share of 40%. These results reflect government electrification ambitions and \nnet zero pledges, including the 2021 COP 26 declaration target to achieve 100% \nzero-emission LDV sales by 2040, and by 2035 in leading markets, which 40 \nnational governments have committed to. \nIn the NZE Scenario, the sales share of electric LDVs reaches 30% in 2025, four \nyears earlier than in the STEPS. In 2030, the sales share is over 60%, about 80% \nhigher than in the STEPS and 55% higher than in the APS. \nBuses \nGovernments have made significant progress in electrifying public bus fleets. In \n2022, there were more than 800 000 electric buses on the road, representing over \n3% of all buses. As such, buses are the most electrified road segment, excluding \ntwo/three-wheelers. In the STEPS, the electric bus fleet reaches 1.4 million in \n2025 and 2.7 million in 2030, at which point around one in ten buses will be \nelectric. In the near term, electrification is expected to progress most rapidly within \nthe publicly owned urban bus fleet, which is covered by government procurement \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 113  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nregulations and, in some cases, government funding. For example, Canada is \naiming to put 5 000 electric public and school buses on the road by the end of \n2025 via the CAD 2.75 billion Zero Emission Transit Fund. \nIn the APS, the electric bus fleet exceeds 3 million in 2030, reaching a stock share \nof over 10 %. In 2030, about a quarter of buses sold are electric, which is about \n35% higher than the sales share in the STEPS. In part, this increase is due to the \nproposed EU heavy-duty vehicle CO2 standards, which would require 100% zero-\nemission city bus sales from 2030. In the NZE Scenario, the electrification of buses \nis even more rapid, with one in two buses sold in 2030 being electric. \nMedium- and heavy-duty trucks \nMedium- and heavy -duty trucks are more difficult to electrify than other road \nsegments, due in part to the size, weight and cost of the batteries needed to fully \nelectrify this segment. However, progress is being made: around 320 000 electric \ntrucks were on the road in 2022. By 2030, the fleet of electric trucks reaches \nalmost 3.5 million in the STEPS, over 3% of the total truck fleet. \nIn the APS, the stock of electric trucks exceeds 4 million in 2030, a stock share of \n4%. Electric truck sales increase from a negligible share today to over 9 % in the \nSTEPS in 2030 and 13% in the APS. The increased sales in the APS are driven \nin particular by the Global Memorandum of Understanding (M oU ) on Zero-\nEmission Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles , through which 27 countries have \nnow pledged to reach 30% zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicle2 sales \nby 2030 and 100% by 2040. In addition, the European Union has proposed HDV \nCO2 standards that would require a 45% reduction in emissions in 2030 compared \nto 2019 levels.  \nIn the NZE Scenario, electric trucks reach 30% of sales in 2030, which is aligned \nwith the Global M oU on Zero-Emission Medium- and Heavy -Duty vehicles . \nHowever, this sales share is still two-and-a-half times that in the APS, and over \nthree times that in the STEPS. \nTwo/three-wheelers \nTwo/three-wheelers are currently the most electrified road transport segment. \nGiven the vehicles\u2019 light weight and limited daily driving distance, battery \nelectrification is relatively easy and makes economic sense on a total cost of \nownership basis in many regions. In 2022, the electric two/three-wheeler fleet \ntotalled over 50 million, reaching a stock share of around 7%.  \nIn the STEPS, the fleet of electric two/three-wheelers reaches 220 million in 2030, \nor a quarter of the total two/three-wheeler fleet. In the APS, the stock grows to \n280 million, and almost 30% of all two/three-wheelers are electric. The electric \nsales share in 2030 reaches 50% in the STEPS and 60% in the APS. In the NZE \nScenario, the electric two/three-wheeler sales share reaches almost 80% in 2030. \n2Includes buses. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 114  \nIEA.

CC BY 4.0. \nChina \nChina once again exceeded expectations for electric car sales  in 2022, reaching \na sales share of around 29%. As such, the government\u2019s target of 20% new energy \nvehicle sales in 2025 was  comfortably met three years ahead of time. China has \ngradually reduced its purchase subsidies for EVs since 2017, but electric car sales \nhave continued to increase strongly. It is expected that sales will continue to grow \ndue, in part, to the increasing availability of affordable EV models, despite 2023 \nbeing the first year without any subsidy.  \nThe sales share of electric cars and vans reaches almost 45% by 2025 in the \nSTEPS, and over 60% in 2030. Given that the government\u2019s electrification targets \nhave already been met, and that 60% electric light-duty vehicle sales in 2030 is \non track with China\u2019s carbon neutrality by 2060 pledge, the electric LDV sales \nshares to 2030 in the APS are the same as in the STEPS. In fact, 60% electric \nLDV sales in 2030 is in line with the global share in the Net Zero Emissions by \n2050 Scenario.  \nChina is the global leader in terms of electric share of the two/three-wheeler fleet, \nwith more than one-third of all two/three-wheelers being electric. In both the \nSTEPS and APS, China is expected to remain the leader in electric two/three-\nwheeler sales. In the STEPS, the sales share of electric two/three-wheelers \nreaches almost 80% in 2030. The APS follows the same trends to 2030. \nChina also has one of the highest stock shares of electric buses, reaching nearly  \n15% in 2022 and totalling over 750  000 (>95% of the global stock). In 2030, the \nsales share of electric buses increases to 50% in both scenarios, up  from 18% in \n2022. While electric sales of medium- and heavy-duty trucks are significantly lower \nthan other road modes, China also led in  electric truck stock in 2022, with over \n95% of the world\u2019s electric trucks. Electric truck sales are projected to reach a \nsales share of nearly one-quarter  in 2030 in both scenarios. Given that other \ncountries have announced truck electrification targets, China\u2019s lack of announced \nambitions means that other countries achieve higher sales shares in the APS. \nThe sales share of EVs across all road transport modes (excluding two/three-\nwheelers) reaches around 60% in 2030 in both scenarios. Across all modes, the \ncurrent market dynamics, and the policy landscape as considered in the STEPS \nto 2030, is sufficient to bring EV sales shares high enough to be in line with China\u2019s \nambition of climate neutrality by 2060, as well as with provincial electrification \ntargets. As such, in China there is no gap between what current policy frameworks \nhave legislated for and what the targets are.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 116  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nEurope \nEurope maintains its status as one of the most advanced EV markets in the \nSTEPS through 2030 in light of recent market trends  and a supportive policy \nlandscape. The 2023 adoption of strict er CO2 standards for cars and vans in the \nEuropean Union has significantly increased electric LDV sales shares in the \nSTEPS. To meet the 2030 target of 55% emissions reduction for cars and 50% \nreduction for vans (compared to 2021 levels), the electric LDV sales share in the \nEuropean Union increases from around 20% in 2022 to almost 65% in 2030. For \nEurope as a whole, electric LDV sales increase from 19% in 2022 to almost 60% \nin 2030. Given that the European Union has now legislated to the level of ambition \nlaid out in the Fit for 55 package, there is no implementation gap for the European \nUnion with respect to LDVs. The electric LDV sales share in 2030 for Europe, \nhowever, is slightly higher in the APS than the STEPS, reaching almost 65% in \nthe APS. This is primarily driven by additional EV sales based on the \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s proposed ZEV mandate  trajectory, which has the overall \nambition to reach 100% zero-emission sales in 2035, as well as the eight non-EU \ncountries in Europe3 that have joined the Accelerating to Zero Coalition.  \nFor buses and trucks, the EU Clean Vehicles Directive  sets minimum \nrequirements for the procurement of \u201cclean\u201d public buses and trucks that vary by \nmember state, with average minimum sales of 33-65% clean buses and 7-15% \nclean trucks from 2026 to 2030. A number of European countries also offer \nfinancial incentives for electric buses and trucks in the form of tax exemptions, \npurchase subsidies and funding to support heavy -duty charging infrastructure. In \nthe STEPS, the sales shares of electric buses and trucks reach 40% and 10% \nrespectively in 2030. Within the European Union the sales shares reach 55% and \naround 13% in 2030. The APS takes into account the European Union\u2019s proposed \nheavy-duty vehicle (HDV) CO2 standards, which would requir e 100% of city bus \nsales to be zero-emission from 2030, and other heavy-duty vehicles to reduce CO2 \nemission by 45% from 2030 compared to 2019 levels. In addition, the APS \nincludes the ambitions of 18 European national governments 4 who have signed \nthe Global Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Zero-Emission Medium- and \nHeavy-Duty Vehicles to r each 30% zero-emission HDV sales shares in 2030 and \n100% in 2040. \nIn Europe, the EV sales share across all modes (excluding two/three-wheelers) is \n55% in 2030 in the STEPS. In the APS, Europe has a combined EV sales share \nof over 60% in 2030 (for electric LDVs, buses and trucks), which is in line with the \nglobal trajectory in the NZE Scenario. Last year, the implementation gap in Europe \nin terms of EV sales share in 2030 was about 15 percentage points. This has now \n \n3 Here, we refer to the Europe regional definition in the IEA\u2019s Global Energy and Climate (GEC) Model, which includes T\u00fcrkiye \nand Israel.  \n4 As Wales, Scotland and the United Kingdom are listed separately as signatories, each is counted in the European total.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 117  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nshrunk to six percentage points, with greater increases in EV sales shares in the \nSTEPS, due to new regulations and market trends, than in the APS due to the \nadditional signatories to zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) initiatives and the proposed \nEU HDV CO2 standards. For the European Union, the implementation gap in 2030 \nacross all modes (excluding two/three-wheelers) has closed from over 10 \npercentage points in the 2022 Outlook to 1 percentage point. \nUnited States \nWith a supportive policy landscape, sales of electric cars and vans  are expected \nto accelerate over the remainder of this decade in the United States, reaching the \ngovernment target of 50% in 2030. With the foundation of stricter US fuel economy \nstandards f or 2024-26 legislated in 2021,5 a slate of new measures are expected \nto promote uptake of electric LDVs, namely: financial incentives for electric cars \nincluded in the Inflation Reduction Act  (IRA), allocated funding for  E V charging \ninfrastructure in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  (IIJA), and growing \nadoption of California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) regulations by  a number \nof states. The implementation gap between the STEPS and APS  LDV sales in \n2030 has fully closed due to the passing of the IRA and adoption of the ACC II \nregulations in 2022.  \nThe IRA also includes a tax credit for the purchase of zero-emission medium- and \nheav\ny-duty trucks, as well as for the installation of EV chargers. In the STEPS, the \nsales share of electric trucks reaches 10% in 2030. In 2022, the United States \nsigned the  Global  Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Zero-Emission \nMedium- and Heavy -Duty Vehicles , with a 2030 target of 30% zero-emission \nvehicles sales across buses and trucks. As such, the electric truck sales share \nreaches slightly less than 30% (which is balanced by higher bus sales shares to \nachieve the overarching target) in 2030 in the APS. The electric bus sales share \nreaches more than 40% in 2030 in the APS, compared to about 30% in the \nSTEPS.  \nIn the United States the EV sales share across all modes (excluding two/three-\nw\nheelers) reaches almost 50% in both the STEPS  and APS. Thus, the  \nimplementation gap for EV sales shares in the United States shrank from around \na 30 percentage points difference in 2030 last year to a negligible difference in \nthis year\u2019s Outlook.  \n5 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed new GHG emissions standards  for  light- and medium-duty vehicles \nin April 2023, which are expected to further promote EV sales. As this was announced after the first quarter of 2023, the \nproposal is not reflected in the scenario projections. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 118  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nJapan \nIn Japan, the sales share of electric cars and vans increases from 3% in 2022 to \n20% in 2030 in the STEPS, in part to comply with the 2030 fuel economy standards \nfor passenger cars. In the APS, electrification of LDVs increases more rapidly to \nreach 30% in 2030, which is in line with the government\u2019s target of 20- 30% EV \nsales for passenger light-duty vehicles  and 20-30% electrified vehicle sales for  \nlight commercial vehicles.  \nJapan also has fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty vehicles, which state that \nefficiency must improve by around 13% for trucks and 14% for buses by the fiscal \nyear 2025 compared to 2015. In 2030, in the STEPS, the electric bus sales share \nreaches almost 30% and the electric truck sales share reaches over 10%. Japan\u2019s \nGreen Growth Strategy  also sets targets for commercial vehicles, including that \n100% of new commercial vehicle sales should be electrified or suitable for the use \nof decarbonised fuels by 2040. In the APS, sales of electric trucks amount to \nalmost 15% in 2030, while the electric bus sales share reaches about 55%.  \nIn Japan, the EV sales share across all modes (excluding two/three-wheelers) is \n20% in 2030 in the STEPS and about 30% in the APS. The \u201cimplementation gap\u201d \nhas remained the same over the past year, as no new policies or ambitions for \nEVs were announced.  \nIndia \nIndia is one of the largest two-wheeler markets in the world, and both the national \nand local governments are promoting electric two-wheelers. For example, \nmodifications to the FAME -II scheme in 2021 increased purchase incentives for \nelectric two-wheelers to cover up to 40% of the price. The sales share of electric \ntwo/three-wheelers in India increases from around 7% in 2022 to almost 50% in \n2030 in the STEPS. In addition, various Indian states have sales or stock targets \nfor electric two- and/or three-wheelers, including Assam, Gujarat, Karntaka and \nMaharashtra. In the APS, the sales share of electric two/three-wheelers reaches \nover 60% in 2030.  \nThe rate of electrification of buses and LDVs is lower, reaching about 20% and \n15% respectively in 2030 in the STEPS. In the APS, electric buses reach a sales \nshare of more than 25% and electric cars and vans  a share of more than 30 % in \n2030. The APS reflects India signing the COP 26 declaration to transition to 100% \nzero-emission LDV sales by 2040 . Whi le there is no national target for electric \nbuses, four Indian states (containing around 15% of India\u2019s population) aim to \nreach 100% electric bus sales by 2030 or earlier.  \nThe EV sales share across all modes (including two/three-wheelers) in India is \nabout 40% in 2030 i n the STEPS (and closer to 14 % if two/three-wheelers are \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 119  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nexcluded). In the APS, EV sales shares in India scale up to over 50% in 2030 \nacross all road vehicle modes (30% excluding two/three-wheelers). The \n\u201cimplementation gap\u201d in India, in terms of EV sales shares, is therefore about \n15 percentage points. \nOther regions \nThe number of countries around the world that have not yet developed a clear \nvision for electromobility  or set targets is declining over time. In emerging and \ndeveloping economies in particular, adoption of EVs can be hindered by a lack of \nfiscal incentives, limited availability of charging infrastructure and purchase price \nhurdles, but the Global Electric Mobility Programme  is working with governments \nin low- and middle-income countries to advance deployment of EVs. \nIn the STEPS, the average EV sales share across regions and countries other \nthan those listed above is about 8% for LDVs, 6% for buses and 1% for trucks in \n2030. In the APS, sales across these other regions reach over 15% of LDVs, 10% \nof buses and 2% of trucks. The countries that have adopted EV-related policies \nand set ambitions tend to have higher EV sales shares than these averages. For \nexample, Canada and Korea both have fuel economy standards for light-duty \nvehicles and purchase incentives for electric  LDVs, and as such the electric LDV \nsales shares reach over 30% in both Canada and Korea in 2030 in the STEPS , \nwhich increase to around 60% for both in the APS.  \nManufacturers\u2019 targets versus scenario projections \nIn most regions, the combined EV sales shar es targeted by OEMs  are either in \nstep with or more ambitious than government pledges in the APS. \nIn addition to the new targets that OEMs have outlined for zero-emission and \nelectric vehicle sales for LDVs  (see Electrification plans by original equipment \nmanufacturers), s everal announcements were made by heavy-duty OEMs in the \npast year. In the United States, Navistar announced targets of 50% zero-emission \nnew vehicle sales by 2030 and 100% by 2040. In China, carbon neutrality (rather \nthan new energy vehicle [ NEV] sales shares) targets of heavy -duty OEMs have \ntypically been at the group or brand level; Dongfeng, BAIC Group, FAW, and SAIC \nhave set targets for carbon peaking, carbon neutrality or net zero emissions, or \nsome combination of the three. \nIn the LDV market, OEM announcements are most ambitious in Europe, and \nroughly equally ambitious in the United States and China. The corporate targets \nin all three markets have followed announcements of policy ambition and \ncommitments to transition to net zero emissions by 2050 in the United States and \nthe European Union and by 2060 in China (Figure 3.5), s howing how policy \nambitions can spur corporate announcements.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 120  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nIn contrast, pivotal policies passed over the past year in the United States \n(including the IRA) have thus far not translated into OEMs in North America raising \ntheir announced level of ambition for electric cars and vans (with the exception of \nGM\u2019s near-term EV sales targets). However, the new legislation has encouraged \nOEMs to make massive investments in EV batteries and production facilities \nbased in North America.  \nFigure 3.5. O riginal Equipment Manufacturer targets and sales shares in the Stated \nPolicies and Announced Pledges scenarios, 2030 \n \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: OEM = original equipment manufacturer. For medium- and heavy-duty trucks, OEM pledges cover the European \nUnion and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) whose members are Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and \nSwitzerland. The figure compares OEM targets for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) (which, for some OEMs, include buses) \nrelative to IEA projections for zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty truck sales (including fuel cell electric vehicles). \nSince annual sales of trucks substantially outnumber sales of buses, achieving HDV targets will require selling zero-\nemission trucks, which is currently more challenging than selling electric buses. The regional average market share in 2030 \nis calculated by collating announcements that explicitly mention ZEV market shares or ZEV sales by the top 10-25 OEMs in \neach region. Electric bus and truck registrations and stock data can be interactively explored via the Global EV Data \nExplorer. \nSources: IEA analysis based on country submissions, complemented by ACEA; EAFO; EV Volumes. \nZero-emission vehicle announcements by manufacturers tend to follow major policy \nannouncements, often surpassing policy ambitions as articulated in the Announced \nPledges Scenario.  \nChina \nIn a market where EV sales shares  currently exceed government targets, \nprojected sales in the STEPS and APS are well aligned with OEM ambitions. New \ntargets were announced by Geely, SAIC -GM-Wuling, BAIC Group and FAW \nGroup in 2022, and BYD ended production of conventional  internal combustion \nengine (ICE) vehicles in early 2022 (see Electrification plans by original equipment \nmanufacturers).  \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\nEurope United\nStates\nChina Japan World Europe\n(EU+EFTA)\nUnited\nStates\nChina\nLight-duty vehicles Medium- and heavy-duty trucks\nSales share\nRange of OEM declarations (estimate) Stated Policies Scenario (2030)\nAnnounced Pledges Scenario (2030) 2022\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 121  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nEurope \nThe electrification plans of OEMs anticipated the adoption of the new EU CO 2 \nstandards for cars and vans, with the result that combined OEM ambitions roughly \nmatch or  exceed the 2030 electric LDV sales share in the STEPS. New  LDV \nelectrification ambitions in the European market have been announced by Ford, \nVolkswagen, and BMW ( see Electrification plans by original equipment \nmanufacturers). Heavy-duty  vehicle makers are most ambitious about the \nEuropean market, with targets reaching around 40% zero-emission vehicles sales \nin 2030. This exceeds what is projected in the STEPS and APS, despite the \nEuropean Commission\u2019s proposal for  a 100% zero-emission target for city buses \nfor 2030, and a 90% CO2 reduction target for trucks for 2040. \nUnited States \nIn the US LDV market, OEM ambitions match or exceed the government\u2019s target \nof 50% EV sales by 2030. However, OEM ambitions in the heavy -duty sector lag \nbehind what is projected in the APS, despite the targets announced by Navistar in \n2022. In part this is due to the United States becoming one of eleven new country \nsignatories to the Global MoU on Zero-Emission Medium - and H eavy-Duty \nVehicles in t he past year, which recently increased ambition. \nBattery demand \nGlobal battery demand continued to grow in 2022 \nGlobal EV battery demand increased by about 65% in 2022, reaching around \n550 GWh, about the same level as EV battery  production. The lithium-ion \nautomotive battery manufacturing capacity in 2022 was roughly 1.5 TWh for the \nyear, implying a utilisation rate of around 35% compared to about 43% in 2021.  \nBattery demand is set to increase significantly by 2030, reaching over 3 TWh in \nthe STEPS and about 3.5 TWh in the APS. To meet that demand, more than \n50 gigafactories (each with 35 GWh of annual production capacity) would be \nneeded by 2030 in the STEPS in addition to today\u2019s battery production capacity. \nThis increases to close to 65 new gigafactories to meet 2030 demand in the APS. \nAccording to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence ( as of March 2023), the announced \nbattery production capacity by private companies for EVs in 2030 amounts to \n6.8 TWh, plenty sufficient to meet demand in both the STEPS and APS. In the \nNZE Scenario, battery demand reaches over 5.5 TWh in 2030. Assuming an \naverage utilisation rate of battery production facilities of 85%, 6  announced \ncapacity in 2030 narrowly covers what is needed in the NZE Scenario. \n6 In 2022, battery manufacturer CATL averaged a capacity utilisation rate of 83.4% for the year. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 122  \nIEA.

Residual capacity therefore represents the manufacturing \ncapacity that would remain unused on average. \nSource: Announced capacity based on data available as of March 2023 from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. \nAnnounced battery manufacturing capacity in 2030 narrowly covers what would be \nrequired to fulfil demand for EV batteries in the Net Zero Scenario.  \nChina is expected to dominate demand for EV batteries up to 2025, in both the \nSTEPS and the APS. However, in the APS, China\u2019s share of EV battery demand \ndeclines to about 35% in 2030, from over 55 % in 2022, due to significant growth \nin EV sales in the United States, Europe and other markets.  \nFigure 3.7.

CC BY 4.0. \nElectric cars and vans are expected to continue to dominate total battery demand \nfor EVs, accounting for around 90% of demand in both scenarios. In the APS, \nbattery demand is projected to reach 120 GWh for buses and 160  GWh for \ntwo/three-wheelers in 2030. Battery demand for trucks increases significantly, \nreaching about 80 GWh in the STEPS and 170 GWh in the APS by 2030.  \nCharging infrastructure \nThe projected deployment of charging infrastructure is underpinned by two main \ntrends. The first is that home or depot charging is the preferred option for EV \ncharging, as it tends to be slow charging (which is more affordable than fast \ncharging) and because these locations are conducive to overnight charging. Slow \nhome or depot charging is also compatible with smart charging and vehicle-to-grid \noperations, and generally puts less strain on the grid than faster charging. As such, \nit is assumed most LDV charging occurs at home, if the owner has access to \nresidential charging, and that electric HDV fleet owners will install depot charging \nfor all buses or trucks with driving schedules that allow for overnight depot \ncharging. However, access to home charging and suitability of depot charging vary \nacross regions and over time. \nSecondly, it is assumed that public and opportunity chargers will gain more \nimportance over time as EV adoption increases. For LDVs, it is assumed that as \nthe stock of electric cars increases, a small er proportion of owners will have \naccess to home charging. For HDVs, it is assumed that as technologies mature, \nmore electric HDVs will be used on longer-range routes. The deployment of public \ncharging should anticipate and enable electrification of these segments. \nRequirements for light-duty vehicle charging \nToday, the majority of electric car and van charging relies on private chargers, \nmainly at the driver\u2019s residence. Early adopters of electric cars and vans  have \ntended to live in single -family detached homes, where home charging is more \nconvenient and more affordable than using public chargers. For example, around \n80% of EV owners in the United States live in single-family homes. Assuming that \naccess to home charging covers  50-80% of the electric  LDV fleet, varying \naccording to the share of population residing in dense urban areas, there were an \nestimated 17.5 million home chargers in 2022. The stock of home chargers \nincreases to 135 million in 2030 in the STEPS and 145 million in the APS.  \nTo strengthen EV adoption across population segments that live in multi -unit \ndwellings, where charger availability may be limited, access to public and \nworkplace charging becomes increasingly important. The stock of workplace \nchargers increases about eightfold by 2030 across the scenarios, while the \nnumber of public chargers increases around fivefold. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 124  \nIEA.

Regional \nprojected electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) stock data can be interactively explored via the Global EV Data \nExplorer. \nBy 2030, public charging points represent fewer than 10% of charging points for light-duty \nvehicles, but 40% of charging capacity.  \nBy 2030, the total installed LDV charger capacity grows more than ninefold to \n1.9 TW in the STEPS, and to more than 2 TW in the APS. For reference, the total \ninstalled capacity  of solar PV worldwide  i n 2021 stood at less than 1 TW. The \ncapacity of public fast chargers grows at the fastest rate, increasing fifteen-fold by \n2030 in the APS, despite the stock of public fast chargers increasing only around \nfivefold. In 2030, the average capacity of fast chargers is about 13 times that of \npublic slow chargers and over 20 times that of private (home and workplace) slow \nchargers.  \nIn 2030, less than 20% of the LDV stock is electric in the APS in most countries. \nA\ns a result, it is expected that the majority of EV owners in 2030 will continue to \nhave access to residential chargers, and the majority (around 60%) of electricity \ndelivered to electric cars and vans will come from these home chargers.

Fast chargers provide more than 22 kW.  \nThe share of electricity for electric cars and vans delivered by public chargers increases to \n30% by 2030. \nRegional trends in public charging infrastructure for cars \nand vans \nPublic charging projections are based on the general trend of a decreasing ratio \nof charging points per EV over time as the market matures and the system is \noptimised, while maintaining reasonable charging capacity per EV.  \nAt the end of 2022, China accounted for about 50% of the electric LDV stock and \n65% of public LDV chargers. China is expected to remain a leader in public \ncharger deployment to 2030, in part due to limited home charger access. In 2030, \nthe stock of public LDV fast chargers reaches almost 5 million in the APS from \nless than 1 million in 2022, and China\u2019s share reduces from about 85% of public \nfast chargers to 70% , as other regions build out their network to keep pace with \nEV deployment targets.

Regional projected EVSE stock data can be interactively explored via the Global EV Data Explorer.  \nThe number of publicly accessible light-duty vehicle chargers increases from about \n3 million in 2022 to around 13 million in 2030 in the Announced Pledges Scenario. \nThe total number of public chargers needed to support LDV electrification in China \nin 2030 is estimated to be around 7.5 million, with a fairly even split between fast \nand slow chargers. In 2025, the stock of electric vehicle supply equipment already \nexceeds 4 million charging points. In terms of targets, the China National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission  has said that charging infrastructure \nshould be sufficient to meet the needs of more than 20 million EVs by 2025. \nHowever, in both scenarios, the projected stock of electric cars and vans in China \nin 2025 is over 40 million. In the IEA scenarios there is therefore a ratio of over \nnine electric LDVs per public charging point in 2025, slightly higher than the eight \nelectric LDVs per public charging point witnessed in 2022. \nIn Europe, the stock of public LDV chargers increases to around 2.4 m illion in 2030 \nin both the STEPS and APS, up from about half a million in 2022. In both \nscenarios, about 80% of the European public charging stock is in the European \nUnion, or around 2 million chargers in 2030.  \nIn March 2023, the European Parliament and Council provisionally agreed  to the \nproposed Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), which sets \nrequirements for the total power capacity to be provided by public charging \ninfrastructure based on the size of the registered fleet and coverage requirements \nfor the trans-European network-transport (TEN-T).

In the APS, the stock of public \nchargers reaches around 280 000 in 2030, of which about 80 000 are fast \nchargers. This means that the share of fast chargers in  the total public electric \nvehicle supply equipment stock increases to around 30%, from 20% in the past \nfew years. The number of electric LDVs per charging point is around 35 and the \ncharging capacity is around 1.5 kW per EV. \nIn the United States, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, \nestablished by the IIJA  of 2021, will distribute up to USD  5 billion in funds from \n2022-2026 to support the development of an EV charging network, with a target \nof 500 000 chargers. In the APS, this level of public electric vehicle supply \nequipment deployment is required before the end of 2025, and the number of \nchargers reac hes over 1.3 million in 2030. In 2030, there are about 30 electric \nLDVs per charging point.  \nJapan\u2019s Green Growth Strategy sets a target of installing 150 000 charging points \nby 2030, including 30 000 fast chargers, with the goal of achieving the same level \nof convenience as refuelling gasoline vehicles. In the APS, the stock of LDV \ncharging points reaches over 200 000 in 2030, of which about 70 000 are fast \nchargers. Such a ratio increases the share of fast chargers only a few percentage \npoints, from about 30% in 2022 to 34% in 2030.  \nIn India, FAME II provides financing and sets objectives for charging infrastructure, \nfor example that chargers be established every 25 km along major highways. In \nMarch 2023, the Ministry of Heavy Industries also announced financial assistance \nfor upstream electric vehicle supply equipment infrastructure. In the APS, the stock \nof public electric LDV charging points reaches 550 000 in 2030, meaning there are \nfewer than 15 electric LDVs per charging point.  \nRequirements for heavy-duty vehicle charging \nIn general, slow charging of EVs is cheaper than fast or ultra-fast charging. For \nHDVs, overnight charging at bus and truck depots is the most convenient way to \ncharge at rates of less than 350-400  kW, which would require close to a one-to-\none ratio of depot chargers per electric HDV.  \nBattery electric trucks and buses with daily ranges that exceed what can be \nprovided from an overnight charge will also need to charge during the day. This \ndaytime charging can take place at the depot or at an opportunity charger (either \nat public or semi-public charging stations, or at destinations). Destination chargers \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 128  \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \ncan be installed at  locations where the vehicle has planned idle time, such as \ndistribution centres where trucks are parked for loading and unloading, or at \nterminal bus stops. For long-distance applications, such as intercity bus routes \nand long-haul trucking, some charging will likely need to take place along \nhighways during breaks.  \nThrough the remainder of this decade, the adoption of electric HDVs is expected \nto centre on city buses and urban and regional delivery applications with short \nrange routes (under 200 km/day), so that operations do not need to depend on \nopportunity charging. However, as the electrification of HDV segments that travel \nlonger daily distances increases over time, opportunity chargers \u2013 especially \nhighway charging \u2013 will be required. High-voltage connections that may be \nrequired for HDV opportunity chargers have long lead times, and so planning is \nneeded in the short-term to ensure adequate availability in the medium - to long-\nterm.  \nFigure 3.11.

Almost a quarter \nof the total EV electricity consumption was for electric cars in China, and a fifth for \nelectric buses in the same country. Electricity demand for  EVs accounts for less \nthan half a percent of current total final electricity consumption worldwide, and still \nless than one percent of China\u2019s final electricity consumption. \nFigure 3.12.

This is in part due to higher rates of electrification in many high-\naverage vehicle mileage markets such as  the United States, but also to greater \nelectrification in the truck and bus segments, which contribute incrementally to \nvehicle stock, but have a high electricity demand per vehicle. In addition, it is \nassumed that in countries with net zero pledges, a larger share of energy \nconsumption in PHEVs is provided by electricity (as opposed to gasoline or \ndiesel). This is particularly relevant for cars and vans, which account for about two-\nthirds of demand in both scenarios.  \nBy 2030, electricity demand for EVs accounts for less than 4 % of global final \nelectricity consumption in both scenarios. As shown in the World Energy Outlook \n2022, in 2030 the share of electricity for EVs is relatively small compared to \ndemand for industrial applications, appliances or cooling and heating. \n Share of electricity consumption from electric vehicles relative to final \nelectricity demand by region and scenario, 2022 and 2030 \nCountry/region 2022 \nStated Policies \nScenario \n2030 \nAnnounced \nPledges Scenario \n2030 \nChina 0.8% 3.8% 4.0% \nEurope 0.7% 4.7% 5.7% \nUnited States 0.4% 5.4% 6.3% \nJapan 0.1% 1.7% 2.2% \nIndia 0.1% 1.7% 2.5% \nGlobal 0.5% 3.2% 3.8% \nNote: Non-road electricity consumption from the World Energy Outlook 2022.  \n \nChina remains the largest consumer of electricity for EVs in 2030, although its \nshare of global EV electricity demand decreases significantly from about 55% in \n2022 to less than 40% in the STEPS, and around 30% in the APS. This reflects \nwider adoption of electromobility across other countries in the period to 2030. \nThe size of the EV fleet becomes an important factor for power systems in both \nscenarios, with implications for peak power demand, transmission and distribution \ncapacity. Careful planning of electricity infrastructure, peak load management, and \nsmart charging will be critical. Reducing dependence on fast charging will allow \nfor optimal planning and resiliency of power systems, mitigating peak power \ndemand. More than 80% of the electricity demand for electric LDVs in 2030 in both \nscenarios is via slow chargers (private and public).  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 131  \nIEA.

Globally, the projected EV fleet in \n2030 displaces more than 5 million barrels per day (mb/d) of diesel and gasoline \nin the STEPS and almost 6 mb/d in the APS, up from about 0.7 mb/d in 2022. For \nreference, Australia consumed around 1 mb/d of oil products across all sectors in \n2021. \nHowever, recent price volatility for critical minerals that are important inputs to \nbattery manufacturing, and market tension affecting supply chains, are a stark \nreminder that in the transition to electromobility , energy security considerations \nevolve and require regular reconsideration. \nFigure 3.13.

CC BY 4.0. \nBox 3.2 How much oil really gets displaced by electric vehicles? \nOil displacement through the use of EVs can be estimated by assuming that the \ndistance (total kilometres) travelled by EVs by segment each year would have \notherwise been travelled by ICE vehicles or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) (based \non the stock shares of each). In the case of PHEVs, only the distance covered by \nelectricity gets included. The stock average fuel consumption of gasoline and \ndiesel vehicles determines the total liquid fuel displacement, where the biofuel \nportion is taken out of the estimate based on regional blending rates. As a result, \nit can be estimated that in 2022, the stock of EVs displaced 700 000 barrels of oil \nper day. \nThis method of estimation assumes that EVs replace ICE or hybrid vehicles of the \nsame segment, as opposed to some other means of transport, i.e. an electric car \nreplaces an ICE car. The accuracy of this assumption is uncertain, in particular \nwith respect to two-wheelers. In IEA analysis, only two-wheelers that fit the United \nNations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) classification of L1 or L3 are \nconsidered. This definition excludes micromobility options such as electric -\nassisted bicycles and low-speed electric scooters, leading to a significantly lower \nstock (around 80% lower) than when including micromobility segments.  \nWhether or not electric micromobility avoids oil use is uncertain, as it might \ndisplace manual bicycles or walking rather than ICE two-wheelers. At the same \ntime, there is evidence that in some cases micromobility displaces per sonal car or \ntaxi trips. T he estimate of the amount of oil use that is avoided by two-wheeled \nmicromobility therefore strongly depends on the assumptions about the mode that \nis being displaced.  \nThe case of China, which represents over 95% of the global stock of two-wheeled \nelectric micromobility, is a good example. Assuming that all two-wheeled \nmicromobility in China replaces conventional ICE two-wheelers would increase oil \ndisplacement by 260 kb/d (or 160%). If instead electric micromobility was assumed \nto replace only bus trips, then the total oil displacement from two-wheelers in China \nwould increase by  just 10 kb/d (10%). However, if it was assumed that they \ndisplaced car trips, then oil use avoided by  two-wheelers in China would be more \nthan 1 mb/d higher. Including oil displacement from the two-wheeled electric \nmicromobility segment in China alone can therefore increase the estimated 2022 \nglobal oil displacement from all electric vehicles anywhere from 1% to 160%. But \nthere is significant uncertainty as to whether any oil is displaced at all. \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 133  \nIEA.

CC BY 4.0 \nNotes: Electric L1 and L3 two-wheelers (based on UNECE classifications) are assumed to replace ICE two-w heelers. \nFor this analysis, it is assumed micromobility two-wheelers travel on average 10 km/day. The mix shown is based on \nfindings from an investigation o f e -bike use in Kunming, China. The other 10% of the mix is assumed to replace active \ntransport, and thus does not contribute to oil displacement. \nSources: IEA analysis based on BNEF and Cherry et al. (2016). \nTax revenues \nTaxes on petroleum-based road fuels can be a significant source of income for \ngovernments, 7  and are often used to support investments in transport \ninfrastructure, such as roads and bridges. Given the levels of oil displacement \ndiscussed above, the transition to EVs will reduce these tax revenues. Additional \ntax revenue from  electricity will not be sufficient to fully compensate for this \nreduction, both because taxes on electricity tend to be lower on an energy basis \nand because EVs are more efficient and thus use less energy than ICE vehicles. \nIn 2022, the transition to electric vehicle stock displaced around USD 11 billion in \ngasoline and diesel tax revenues globally . At the same time, the use of EVs \ngenerated around USD  2 billion in electricity tax revenue, meaning there was a \nnet loss of around USD  9 billion. Although China has the greatest stock of EVs, \nthe greatest impact on tax revenues was seen in Europe, a trend which is \nexpected to continue into the future. This is because Europe has some of the \nhighest taxes on gasoline and diesel; for example, the gasoline tax rate in \nGermany is almost ten times the rate in China. \nAs the number of EVs increases globally, government fuel tax revenues are \nexpected to decline, with global net tax losses increasing by around two-and-a-\n7 While the share of total government revenue from fuel taxes may be small, for example it has recently been less than 3%  \nin the United Kingdom, in many cases it represents a large share of the budget allocations for transportation infrastructure. \n-1.40\n-1.20\n-1.00\n-0.80\n-0.60\n-0.40\n-0.20\n0.00\nCar trips (100%) L1/L3 trips (100%) Bus trips (100%)\nMix: car (25%), bus\n(55%), L1/L3 (10%)\nAssuming micromobility replaces:\nmb/d\nElectric two-wheelers (L1 and L3) Additional oil displacement from electric micromobility\n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 134  \nIEA.

Impacts in the United States appear limited, with a total net loss \nof tax revenue of less than half a billion USD in 2030. However, this value is based \non federal tax rates and thus does not represent the full impact at the state level. \nIn 2022, the state tax rate on gasoline was on average around 70% higher than \nfederal rate. \nFigure 3.14.

Fuel tax rates are assumed to remain \nconstant. Only federal tax rates are included. \nSources: Analysis based on tax rates from IEA Energy Prices. \nAdditional tax revenue from electricity demand is not sufficient to balance the effects of \ndisplaced oil product consumption on fuel tax revenues. \nGovernments need to anticipate a reduction in fuel tax revenues and develop new \ntax strategies to maintain revenue levels without discouraging the adoption of EVs. \nIn the short- term, governments can increase tax rates to balance the decline in \nfossil fuel use, for example through a fuel tax escalator . However, this type of \nmeasure can be politically unpopular and create equity issues, especially in times \nof relatively high oil prices.  \nLonger- term measures to stabilise tax revenues that involve deeper reforms in tax \nschemes should be gradually phased in  to allow for smooth adaptation to new \nvehicle technologies. For example, these reforms could include coupling higher \ntaxes on carbon-intensive fuels with distance-based charges.

In addition, distance -based charges, such as thos e that vary by \ntime, place and vehicle type, could also reduce traffic congestion, noise and road \ninfrastructure damage. \nGreenhouse gas emissions \nIn 2022, EVs enabled a net reduction of about 80 Mt of GHG emissions, on a well-\nto-wheels basis. The biggest savings were achieved from EVs in China, where \nalmost 30% of global emissions reductions come from the electrification of \npassenger cars in China. As the EV fleet continues to grow, it will contribute to \nfurther reducing GHG emissions on well -to-wheel basis through 2030. The net \nGHG benefit of EVs increases over time as the electricity sector is decarbonised. \nThe global average GHG intensity of electricity generation and deli very falls from \n2022 to 2030 by 28% in the STEPS, and by 37% in the APS.  \nIn the STEPS, the net GHG emissions avoided through the use of EVs reaches \nnearly 700 Mt CO2-equivalent in 2030. The production of electricity to fuel the EV \nfleet in 2030 in the STE PS results in 29 0 Mt CO2-eq emissions, but this is more \nthan offset by the avoidance of 980 Mt CO2-eq that would have been emitted from \nan equivalent ICE vehicle fleet. \nIn the APS, the GHG emissions reduction benefit of EV adoption increases further, \ndue to both a higher stock of EVs and a lower GHG intensity of electricity \ngeneration. The net GHG emissions avoided in 2030 are over 770 Mt CO2-eq. \nIn the STEPS and the APS, electric LDVs as a segment contribute the majority of \nemissions avoided from 2022-2030, and the two/three-wheelers segment forms \nthe next largest contributor. In the NZE Scenario, trucks play a key role in \ndelivering the avoided emissions targets for achieving net zero goals.  \n\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment \nCatching up with climate ambitions \nPAGE | 136  \nIEA.

Since no concrete type information\nis available, traditional compilers need to emit generic code that can\nhandle all possible type combinations at runtime. We present an al-\nternative compilation technique for dynamically-typed languages\nthat identi\ufb01es frequently executed loop traces at run-time and then\ngenerates machine code on the \ufb02y that is specialized for the ac-\ntual dynamic types occurring on each path through the loop. Our\nmethod provides cheap inter-procedural type specialization, and an\nelegant and ef\ufb01cient way of incrementally compiling lazily discov-\nered alternative paths through nested loops. We have implemented\na dynamic compiler for JavaScript based on our technique and we\nhave measured speedups of 10x and more for certain benchmark\nprograms.\nCategories and Subject Descriptors D.3.4 [ Programming Lan-\nguages]: Processors \u2014 Incremental compilers, code generation .\nGeneral Terms Design, Experimentation, Measurement, Perfor-\nmance.\nKeywords JavaScript, just-in-time compilation, trace trees.\n1. Introduction\nDynamic languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, are pop-\nular since they are expressive, accessible to non-experts, and make\ndeployment as easy as distributing a source \ufb01le. They are used for\nsmall scripts as well as for complex applications. JavaScript, for\nexample, is the de facto standard for client-side web programming\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor pro\ufb01t or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the \ufb01rst page.

In this domain, in order to provide a \ufb02uid user\nexperience and enable a new generation of applications, virtual ma-\nchines must provide a low startup time and high performance.\nCompilers for statically typed languages rely on type informa-\ntion to generate ef\ufb01cient machine code. In a dynamically typed pro-\ngramming language such as JavaScript, the types of expressions\nmay vary at runtime. This means that the compiler can no longer\neasily transform operations into machine instructions that operate\non one speci\ufb01c type. Without exact type information, the compiler\nmust emit slower generalized machine code that can deal with all\npotential type combinations. While compile-time static type infer-\nence might be able to gather type information to generate opti-\nmized machine code, traditional static analysis is very expensive\nand hence not well suited for the highly interactive environment of\na web browser.\nWe present a trace-based compilation technique for dynamic\nlanguages that reconciles speed of compilation with excellent per-\nformance of the generated machine code. Our system uses a mixed-\nmode execution approach: the system starts running JavaScript in a\nfast-starting bytecode interpreter. As the program runs, the system\nidenti\ufb01es hot (frequently executed) bytecode sequences, records\nthem, and compiles them to fast native code. We call such a se-\nquence of instructions a trace.\nUnlike method-based dynamic compilers, our dynamic com-\npiler operates at the granularity of individual loops. This design\nchoice is based on the expectation that programs spend most of\ntheir time in hot loops. Even in dynamically typed languages, we\nexpect hot loops to be mostly type-stable, meaning that the types of\nvalues are invariant. (12) For example, we would expect loop coun-\nters that start as integers to remain integers for all iterations. When\nboth of these expectations hold, a trace-based compiler can cover\nthe program execution with a small number of type-specialized, ef-\n\ufb01ciently compiled traces.\nEach compiled trace covers one path through the program with\none mapping of values to types. When the VM executes a compiled\ntrace, it cannot guarantee that the same path will be followed\nor that the same types will occur in subsequent loop iterations.\n\nHence, recording and compiling a trace speculates that the path and\ntyping will be exactly as they were during recording for subsequent\niterations of the loop.\nEvery compiled trace contains all the guards (checks) required\nto validate the speculation. If one of the guards fails (if control\n\ufb02ow is different, or a value of a different type is generated), the\ntrace exits. If an exit becomes hot, the VM can record a branch\ntrace starting at the exit to cover the new path. In this way, the VM\nrecords a trace tree covering all the hot paths through the loop.\nNested loops can be dif\ufb01cult to optimize for tracing VMs. In\na na \u00a8\u0131ve implementation, inner loops would become hot \ufb01rst, and\nthe VM would start tracing there. When the inner loop exits, the\nVM would detect that a different branch was taken. The VM would\ntry to record a branch trace, and \ufb01nd that the trace reaches not the\ninner loop header, but the outer loop header. At this point, the VM\ncould continue tracing until it reaches the inner loop header again,\nthus tracing the outer loop inside a trace tree for the inner loop.\nBut this requires tracing a copy of the outer loop for every side exit\nand type combination in the inner loop. In essence, this is a form\nof unintended tail duplication, which can easily over\ufb02ow the code\ncache. Alternatively, the VM could simply stop tracing, and give up\non ever tracing outer loops.\nWe solve the nested loop problem by recording nested trace\ntrees. Our system traces the inner loop exactly as the na \u00a8\u0131ve version.\nThe system stops extending the inner tree when it reaches an outer\nloop, but then it starts a new trace at the outer loop header. When\nthe outer loop reaches the inner loop header, the system tries to call\nthe trace tree for the inner loop. If the call succeeds, the VM records\nthe call to the inner tree as part of the outer trace and \ufb01nishes\nthe outer trace as normal. In this way, our system can trace any\nnumber of loops nested to any depth without causing excessive tail\nduplication.\nThese techniques allow a VM to dynamically translate a pro-\ngram to nested, type-specialized trace trees. Because traces can\ncross function call boundaries, our techniques also achieve the ef-\nfects of inlining. Because traces have no internal control-\ufb02ow joins,\nthey can be optimized in linear time by a simple compiler (10).\nThus, our tracing VM ef\ufb01ciently performs the same kind of op-\ntimizations that would require interprocedural analysis in a static\noptimization setting. This makes tracing an attractive and effective\ntool to type specialize even complex function call-rich code.\nWe implemented these techniques for an existing JavaScript in-\nterpreter, SpiderMonkey. We call the resulting tracing VM Trace-\nMonkey. TraceMonkey supports all the JavaScript features of Spi-\nderMonkey, with a 2x-20x speedup for traceable programs.\nThis paper makes the following contributions:\n\u2022 We explain an algorithm for dynamically forming trace trees to\ncover a program, representing nested loops as nested trace trees.\n\u2022 We explain how to speculatively generate ef\ufb01cient type-specialized\ncode for traces from dynamic language programs.\n\u2022 We validate our tracing techniques in an implementation based\non the SpiderMonkey JavaScript interpreter, achieving 2x-20x\nspeedups on many programs.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 3 is\na general overview of trace tree based compilation we use to cap-\nture and compile frequently executed code regions. In Section 4\nwe describe our approach of covering nested loops using a num-\nber of individual trace trees. In Section 5 we describe our trace-\ncompilation based speculative type specialization approach we use\nto generate ef\ufb01cient machine code from recorded bytecode traces.\nOur implementation of a dynamic type-specializing compiler for\nJavaScript is described in Section 6. Related work is discussed in\nSection 8. In Section 7 we evaluate our dynamic compiler based on\n1 for (var i = 2; i < 100; ++i) {\n2 if (!primes[i])\n3 continue;\n4 for (var k = i + i; i < 100; k += i)\n5 primes[k] = false;\n6 }\nFigure 1.

The paper ends with conclusions in\nSection 9 and an outlook on future work is presented in Section 10.\n2. Overview: Example Tracing Run\nThis section provides an overview of our system by describing\nhow TraceMonkey executes an example program. The example\nprogram, shown in Figure 1, computes the \ufb01rst 100 prime numbers\nwith nested loops. The narrative should be read along with Figure 2,\nwhich describes the activities TraceMonkey performs and when it\ntransitions between the loops.\nTraceMonkey always begins executing a program in the byte-\ncode interpreter. Every loop back edge is a potential trace point.\nWhen the interpreter crosses a loop edge, TraceMonkey invokes\nthe trace monitor , which may decide to record or execute a native\ntrace. At the start of execution, there are no compiled traces yet, so\nthe trace monitor counts the number of times each loop back edge is\nexecuted until a loop becomes hot, currently after 2 crossings. Note\nthat the way our loops are compiled, the loop edge is crossed before\nentering the loop, so the second crossing occurs immediately after\nthe \ufb01rst iteration.\nHere is the sequence of events broken down by outer loop\niteration:\n\nv0 := ld state[748] // load primes from the trace activation record\nst sp[0], v0 // store primes to interpreter stack\nv1 := ld state[764] // load k from the trace activation record\nv2 := i2f(v1) // convert k from int to double\nst sp[8], v1 // store k to interpreter stack\nst sp[16], 0 // store false to interpreter stack\nv3 := ld v0[4] // load class word for primes\nv4 := and v3, -4 // mask out object class tag for primes\nv5 := eq v4, Array // test whether primes is an array\nxf v5 // side exit if v5 is false\nv6 := js_Array_set(v0, v2, false) // call function to set array element\nv7 := eq v6, 0 // test return value from call\nxt v7 // side exit if js_Array_set returns false.\nFigure 3. LIR snippet for sample program.This is the LIR recorded for line 5 of the sample program in Figure 1. The LIR encodes\nthe semantics in SSA form using temporary variables. The LIR also encodes all the stores that the interpreter would do to its data stack.\nSometimes these stores can be optimized away as the stack locations are live only on exits to the interpreter. Finally, the LIR records guards\nand side exits to verify the assumptions made in this recording: that primes is an array and that the call to set its element succeeds.\nmov edx, ebx(748) // load primes from the trace activation record\nmov edi(0), edx // (*) store primes to interpreter stack\nmov esi, ebx(764) // load k from the trace activation record\nmov edi(8), esi // (*) store k to interpreter stack\nmov edi(16), 0 // (*) store false to interpreter stack\nmov eax, edx(4) // (*) load object class word for primes\nand eax, -4 // (*) mask out object class tag for primes\ncmp eax, Array // (*) test whether primes is an array\njne side_exit_1 // (*) side exit if primes is not an array\nsub esp, 8 // bump stack for call alignment convention\npush false // push last argument for call\npush esi // push first argument for call\ncall js_Array_set // call function to set array element\nadd esp, 8 // clean up extra stack space\nmov ecx, ebx // (*) created by register allocator\ntest eax, eax // (*) test return value of js_Array_set\nje side_exit_2 // (*) side exit if call failed\n...\nside_exit_1:\nmov ecx, ebp(-4) // restore ecx\nmov esp, ebp // restore esp\njmp epilog // jump to ret statement\nFigure 4. x86 snippet for sample program.This is the x86 code compiled from the LIR snippet in Figure 3. Most LIR instructions compile\nto a single x86 instruction. Instructions marked with (*) would be omitted by an idealized compiler that knew that none of the side exits\nwould ever be taken. The 17 instructions generated by the compiler compare favorably with the 100+ instructions that the interpreter would\nexecute for the same code snippet, including 4 indirect jumps.\ni=2. This is the \ufb01rst iteration of the outer loop. The loop on\nlines 4-5 becomes hot on its second iteration, so TraceMonkey en-\nters recording mode on line 4. In recording mode, TraceMonkey\nrecords the code along the trace in a low-level compiler intermedi-\nate representation we call LIR. The LIR trace encodes all the oper-\nations performed and the types of all operands. The LIR trace also\nencodes guards, which are checks that verify that the control \ufb02ow\nand types are identical to those observed during trace recording.\nThus, on later executions, if and only if all guards are passed, the\ntrace has the required program semantics.\nTraceMonkey stops recording when execution returns to the\nloop header or exits the loop. In this case, execution returns to the\nloop header on line 4.\nAfter recording is \ufb01nished, TraceMonkey compiles the trace to\nnative code using the recorded type information for optimization.\nThe result is a native code fragment that can be entered if the\ninterpreter PC and the types of values match those observed when\ntrace recording was started. The \ufb01rst trace in our example, T45,\ncovers lines 4 and 5. This trace can be entered if the PC is at line 4,\ni and k are integers, and primes is an object. After compiling T45,\nTraceMonkey returns to the interpreter and loops back to line 1.\ni=3. Now the loop header at line 1 has become hot, so Trace-\nMonkey starts recording. When recording reaches line 4, Trace-\nMonkey observes that it has reached an inner loop header that al-\nready has a compiled trace, so TraceMonkey attempts to nest the\ninner loop inside the current trace. The \ufb01rst step is to call the inner\ntrace as a subroutine. This executes the loop on line 4 to completion\nand then returns to the recorder. TraceMonkey veri\ufb01es that the call\nwas successful and then records the call to the inner trace as part of\nthe current trace. Recording continues until execution reaches line\n1, and at which point TraceMonkey \ufb01nishes and compiles a trace\nfor the outer loop, T16.\n\ni=4. On this iteration, TraceMonkey calls T16. Because i=4, the\nif statement on line 2 is taken. This branch was not taken in the\noriginal trace, so this causes T16 to fail a guard and take a side exit.\nThe exit is not yet hot, so TraceMonkey returns to the interpreter,\nwhich executes the continue statement.\ni=5. TraceMonkey calls T16, which in turn calls the nested trace\nT45. T16 loops back to its own header, starting the next iteration\nwithout ever returning to the monitor.\ni=6. On this iteration, the side exit on line 2 is taken again. This\ntime, the side exit becomes hot, so a trace T23,1 is recorded that\ncovers line 3 and returns to the loop header. Thus, the end of T23,1\njumps directly to the start of T16. The side exit is patched so that\non future iterations, it jumps directly to T23,1.\nAt this point, TraceMonkey has compiled enough traces to cover\nthe entire nested loop structure, so the rest of the program runs\nentirely as native code.\n3. Trace Trees\nIn this section, we describe traces, trace trees, and how they are\nformed at run time. Although our techniques apply to any dynamic\nlanguage interpreter, we will describe them assuming a bytecode\ninterpreter to keep the exposition simple.\n3.1 Traces\nA trace is simply a program path, which may cross function call\nboundaries. TraceMonkey focuses on loop traces , that originate at\na loop edge and represent a single iteration through the associated\nloop.\nSimilar to an extended basic block, a trace is only entered at\nthe top, but may have many exits. In contrast to an extended basic\nblock, a trace can contain join nodes. Since a trace always only\nfollows one single path through the original program, however, join\nnodes are not recognizable as such in a trace and have a single\npredecessor node like regular nodes.\nA typed trace is a trace annotated with a type for every variable\n(including temporaries) on the trace. A typed trace also has an entry\ntype map giving the required types for variables used on the trace\nbefore they are de\ufb01ned. For example, a trace could have a type map\n(x: int, b: boolean), meaning that the trace may be entered\nonly if the value of the variable x is of type int and the value of b\nis of type boolean. The entry type map is much like the signature\nof a function.\nIn this paper, we only discuss typed loop traces, and we will\nrefer to them simply as \u201ctraces\u201d. The key property of typed loop\ntraces is that they can be compiled to ef\ufb01cient machine code using\nthe same techniques used for typed languages.\nIn TraceMonkey, traces are recorded in trace-\ufb02avored SSA LIR\n(low-level intermediate representation). In trace-\ufb02avored SSA (or\nTSSA), phi nodes appear only at the entry point, which is reached\nboth on entry and via loop edges. The important LIR primitives\nare constant values, memory loads and stores (by address and\noffset), integer operators, \ufb02oating-point operators, function calls,\nand conditional exits. Type conversions, such as integer to double,\nare represented by function calls. This makes the LIR used by\nTraceMonkey independent of the concrete type system and type\nconversion rules of the source language. The LIR operations are\ngeneric enough that the backend compiler is language independent.\nFigure 3 shows an example LIR trace.\nBytecode interpreters typically represent values in a various\ncomplex data structures (e.g., hash tables) in a boxed format (i.e.,\nwith attached type tag bits). Since a trace is intended to represent\nef\ufb01cient code that eliminates all that complexity, our traces oper-\nate on unboxed values in simple variables and arrays as much as\npossible.\nA trace records all its intermediate values in a small activation\nrecord area. To make variable accesses fast on trace, the trace also\nimports local and global variables by unboxing them and copying\nthem to its activation record. Thus, the trace can read and write\nthese variables with simple loads and stores from a native activation\nrecording, independently of the boxing mechanism used by the\ninterpreter. When the trace exits, the VM boxes the values from\nthis native storage location and copies them back to the interpreter\nstructures.\nFor every control-\ufb02ow branch in the source program, the\nrecorder generates conditional exit LIR instructions. These instruc-\ntions exit from the trace if required control \ufb02ow is different from\nwhat it was at trace recording, ensuring that the trace instructions\nare run only if they are supposed to. We call these instructions\nguard instructions.\nMost of our traces represent loops and end with the special loop\nLIR instruction. This is just an unconditional branch to the top of\nthe trace. Such traces return only via guards.\nNow, we describe the key optimizations that are performed as\npart of recording LIR. All of these optimizations reduce complex\ndynamic language constructs to simple typed constructs by spe-\ncializing for the current trace. Each optimization requires guard in-\nstructions to verify their assumptions about the state and exit the\ntrace if necessary.\nType specialization.\nAll LIR primitives apply to operands of speci\ufb01c types. Thus,\nLIR traces are necessarily type-specialized, and a compiler can\neasily produce a translation that requires no type dispatches. A\ntypical bytecode interpreter carries tag bits along with each value,\nand to perform any operation, must check the tag bits, dynamically\ndispatch, mask out the tag bits to recover the untagged value,\nperform the operation, and then reapply tags. LIR omits everything\nexcept the operation itself.\nA potential problem is that some operations can produce values\nof unpredictable types. For example, reading a property from an\nobject could yield a value of any type, not necessarily the type\nobserved during recording. The recorder emits guard instructions\nthat conditionally exit if the operation yields a value of a different\ntype from that seen during recording. These guard instructions\nguarantee that as long as execution is on trace, the types of values\nmatch those of the typed trace. When the VM observes a side exit\nalong such a type guard, a new typed trace is recorded originating\nat the side exit location, capturing the new type of the operation in\nquestion.\nRepresentation specialization: objects. In JavaScript, name\nlookup semantics are complex and potentially expensive because\nthey include features like object inheritance and eval. To evaluate\nan object property read expression like o.x, the interpreter must\nsearch the property map of o and all of its prototypes and parents.\nProperty maps can be implemented with different data structures\n(e.g., per-object hash tables or shared hash tables), so the search\nprocess also must dispatch on the representation of each object\nfound during search. TraceMonkey can simply observe the result of\nthe search process and record the simplest possible LIR to access\nthe property value. For example, the search might \ufb01nds the value of\no.x in the prototype of o, which uses a shared hash-table represen-\ntation that places x in slot 2 of a property vector. Then the recorded\ncan generate LIR that reads o.x with just two or three loads: one to\nget the prototype, possibly one to get the property value vector, and\none more to get slot 2 from the vector. This is a vast simpli\ufb01cation\nand speedup compared to the original interpreter code. Inheritance\nrelationships and object representations can change during execu-\ntion, so the simpli\ufb01ed code requires guard instructions that ensure\nthe object representation is the same. In TraceMonkey, objects\u2019 rep-\n\nresentations are assigned an integer key called the object shape .\nThus, the guard is a simple equality check on the object shape.\nRepresentation specialization: numbers. JavaScript has no\ninteger type, only a Number type that is the set of 64-bit IEEE-\n754 \ufb02oating-pointer numbers (\u201cdoubles\u201d). But many JavaScript\noperators, in particular array accesses and bitwise operators, really\noperate on integers, so they \ufb01rst convert the number to an integer,\nand then convert any integer result back to a double. 1 Clearly, a\nJavaScript VM that wants to be fast must \ufb01nd a way to operate on\nintegers directly and avoid these conversions.\nIn TraceMonkey, we support two representations for numbers:\nintegers and doubles. The interpreter uses integer representations\nas much as it can, switching for results that can only be represented\nas doubles. When a trace is started, some values may be imported\nand represented as integers. Some operations on integers require\nguards. For example, adding two integers can produce a value too\nlarge for the integer representation.\nFunction inlining. LIR traces can cross function boundaries\nin either direction, achieving function inlining. Move instructions\nneed to be recorded for function entry and exit to copy arguments\nin and return values out. These move statements are then optimized\naway by the compiler using copy propagation. In order to be able\nto return to the interpreter, the trace must also generate LIR to\nrecord that a call frame has been entered and exited. The frame\nentry and exit LIR saves just enough information to allow the\nintepreter call stack to be restored later and is much simpler than\nthe interpreter\u2019s standard call code. If the function being entered\nis not constant (which in JavaScript includes any call by function\nname), the recorder must also emit LIR to guard that the function\nis the same.\nGuards and side exits. Each optimization described above\nrequires one or more guards to verify the assumptions made in\ndoing the optimization. A guard is just a group of LIR instructions\nthat performs a test and conditional exit. The exit branches to a\nside exit , a small off-trace piece of LIR that returns a pointer to\na structure that describes the reason for the exit along with the\ninterpreter PC at the exit point and any other data needed to restore\nthe interpreter\u2019s state structures.\nAborts. Some constructs are dif\ufb01cult to record in LIR traces.\nFor example, eval or calls to external functions can change the\nprogram state in unpredictable ways, making it dif\ufb01cult for the\ntracer to know the current type map in order to continue tracing.\nA tracing implementation can also have any number of other limi-\ntations, e.g.,a small-memory device may limit the length of traces.\nWhen any situation occurs that prevents the implementation from\ncontinuing trace recording, the implementation aborts trace record-\ning and returns to the trace monitor.\n3.2 Trace Trees\nEspecially simple loops, namely those where control \ufb02ow, value\ntypes, value representations, and inlined functions are all invariant,\ncan be represented by a single trace. But most loops have at least\nsome variation, and so the program will take side exits from the\nmain trace. When a side exit becomes hot, TraceMonkey starts a\nnew branch trace from that point and patches the side exit to jump\ndirectly to that trace. In this way, a single trace expands on demand\nto a single-entry, multiple-exit trace tree.\nThis section explains how trace trees are formed during execu-\ntion. The goal is to form trace trees during execution that cover all\nthe hot paths of the program.\n1 Arrays are actually worse than this: if the index value is a number, it must\nbe converted from a double to a string for the property access operator, and\nthen to an integer internally to the array implementation.\nStarting a tree.Tree trees always start at loop headers, because\nthey are a natural place to look for hot paths. In TraceMonkey, loop\nheaders are easy to detect\u2013the bytecode compiler ensures that a\nbytecode is a loop header iff it is the target of a backward branch.\nTraceMonkey starts a tree when a given loop header has been exe-\ncuted a certain number of times (2 in the current implementation).\nStarting a tree just means starting recording a trace for the current\npoint and type map and marking the trace as the root of a tree. Each\ntree is associated with a loop header and type map, so there may be\nseveral trees for a given loop header.\nClosing the loop.Trace recording can end in several ways.\nIdeally, the trace reaches the loop header where it started with\nthe same type map as on entry. This is called a type-stable loop\niteration. In this case, the end of the trace can jump right to the\nbeginning, as all the value representations are exactly as needed to\nenter the trace. The jump can even skip the usual code that would\ncopy out the state at the end of the trace and copy it back in to the\ntrace activation record to enter a trace.\nIn certain cases the trace might reach the loop header with a\ndifferent type map. This scenario is sometime observed for the \ufb01rst\niteration of a loop. Some variables inside the loop might initially be\nunde\ufb01ned, before they are set to a concrete type during the \ufb01rst loop\niteration. When recording such an iteration, the recorder cannot\nlink the trace back to its own loop header since it is type-unstable.\nInstead, the iteration is terminated with a side exit that will always\nfail and return to the interpreter. At the same time a new trace is\nrecorded with the new type map. Every time an additional type-\nunstable trace is added to a region, its exit type map is compared to\nthe entry map of all existing traces in case they complement each\nother. With this approach we are able to cover type-unstable loop\niterations as long they eventually form a stable equilibrium.\nFinally, the trace might exit the loop before reaching the loop\nheader, for example because execution reaches a break or return\nstatement. In this case, the VM simply ends the trace with an exit\nto the trace monitor.\nAs mentioned previously, we may speculatively chose to rep-\nresent certain Number-typed values as integers on trace. We do so\nwhen we observe that Number-typed variables contain an integer\nvalue at trace entry. If during trace recording the variable is unex-\npectedly assigned a non-integer value, we have to widen the type\nof the variable to a double. As a result, the recorded trace becomes\ninherently type-unstable since it starts with an integer value but\nends with a double value. This represents a mis-speculation, since\nat trace entry we specialized the Number-typed value to an integer,\nassuming that at the loop edge we would again \ufb01nd an integer value\nin the variable, allowing us to close the loop. To avoid future spec-\nulative failures involving this variable, and to obtain a type-stable\ntrace we note the fact that the variable in question as been observed\nto sometimes hold non-integer values in an advisory data structure\nwhich we call the \u201coracle\u201d.\nWhen compiling loops, we consult the oracle before specializ-\ning values to integers. Speculation towards integers is performed\nonly if no adverse information is known to the oracle about that\nparticular variable. Whenever we accidentally compile a loop that\nis type-unstable due to mis-speculation of a Number-typed vari-\nable, we immediately trigger the recording of a new trace, which\nbased on the now updated oracle information will start with a dou-\nble value and thus become type stable.\nExtending a tree. Side exits lead to different paths through\nthe loop, or paths with different types or representations. Thus, to\ncompletely cover the loop, the VM must record traces starting at all\nside exits. These traces are recorded much like root traces: there is\na counter for each side exit, and when the counter reaches a hotness\nthreshold, recording starts. Recording stops exactly as for the root\ntrace, using the loop header of the root trace as the target to reach.\n\nOur implementation does not extend at all side exits. It extends\nonly if the side exit is for a control-\ufb02ow branch, and only if the side\nexit does not leave the loop. In particular we do not want to extend\na trace tree along a path that leads to an outer loop, because we\nwant to cover such paths in an outer tree through tree nesting.\n3.3 Blacklisting\nSometimes, a program follows a path that cannot be compiled\ninto a trace, usually because of limitations in the implementation.\nTraceMonkey does not currently support recording throwing and\ncatching of arbitrary exceptions. This design trade off was chosen,\nbecause exceptions are usually rare in JavaScript. However, if a\nprogram opts to use exceptions intensively, we would suddenly\nincur a punishing runtime overhead if we repeatedly try to record\na trace for this path and repeatedly fail to do so, since we abort\ntracing every time we observe an exception being thrown.\nAs a result, if a hot loop contains traces that always fail, the VM\ncould potentially run much more slowly than the base interpreter:\nthe VM repeatedly spends time trying to record traces, but is never\nable to run any. To avoid this problem, whenever the VM is about\nto start tracing, it must try to predict whether it will \ufb01nish the trace.\nOur prediction algorithm is based on blacklisting traces that\nhave been tried and failed. When the VM fails to \ufb01nish a trace start-\ning at a given point, the VM records that a failure has occurred. The\nVM also sets a counter so that it will not try to record a trace starting\nat that point until it is passed a few more times (32 in our imple-\nmentation). This backoff counter gives temporary conditions that\nprevent tracing a chance to end. For example, a loop may behave\ndifferently during startup than during its steady-state execution. Af-\nter a given number of failures (2 in our implementation), the VM\nmarks the fragment as blacklisted, which means the VM will never\nagain start recording at that point.\nAfter implementing this basic strategy, we observed that for\nsmall loops that get blacklisted, the system can spend a noticeable\namount of time just \ufb01nding the loop fragment and determining that\nit has been blacklisted. We now avoid that problem by patching the\nbytecode. We de\ufb01ne an extra no-op bytecode that indicates a loop\nheader. The VM calls into the trace monitor every time the inter-\npreter executes a loop header no-op. To blacklist a fragment, we\nsimply replace the loop header no-op with a regular no-op. Thus,\nthe interpreter will never again even call into the trace monitor.\nThere is a related problem we have not yet solved, which occurs\nwhen a loop meets all of these conditions:\n\u2022 The VM can form at least one root trace for the loop.\n\u2022 There is at least one hot side exit for which the VM cannot\ncomplete a trace.\n\u2022 The loop body is short.\nIn this case, the VM will repeatedly pass the loop header, search\nfor a trace, \ufb01nd it, execute it, and fall back to the interpreter.\nWith a short loop body, the overhead of \ufb01nding and calling the\ntrace is high, and causes performance to be even slower than the\nbasic interpreter. So far, in this situation we have improved the\nimplementation so that the VM can complete the branch trace.\nBut it is hard to guarantee that this situation will never happen.\nAs future work, this situation could be avoided by detecting and\nblacklisting loops for which the average trace call executes few\nbytecodes before returning to the interpreter.\n4. Nested Trace Tree Formation\nFigure 7 shows basic trace tree compilation (11) applied to a nested\nloop where the inner loop contains two paths. Usually, the inner\nloop (with header at i2) becomes hot \ufb01rst, and a trace tree is rooted\nat that point. For example, the \ufb01rst recorded trace may be a cycle\nT\nTrunk\u2029Trace\nTree\u2029Anchor\nTrace\u2029Anchor\nBranch\u2029Trace\nGuard\nSide\u2029Exit\nFigure 5.

We handle type-unstable loops by allowing traces to\ncompile that cannot loop back to themselves due to a type mis-\nmatch. As such traces accumulate, we attempt to connect their loop\nedges to form groups of trace trees that can execute without having\nto side-exit to the interpreter to cover odd type cases. This is par-\nticularly important for nested trace trees where an outer tree tries to\ncall an inner tree (or in this case a forest of inner trees), since inner\nloops frequently have initially unde\ufb01ned values which change type\nto a concrete value after the \ufb01rst iteration.\nthrough the inner loop, {i2, i3, i5, \u03b1}. The \u03b1 symbol is used to\nindicate that the trace loops back the tree anchor.\nWhen execution leaves the inner loop, the basic design has two\nchoices. First, the system can stop tracing and give up on compiling\nthe outer loop, clearly an undesirable solution. The other choice is\nto continue tracing, compiling traces for the outer loop inside the\ninner loop\u2019s trace tree.\nFor example, the program might exit at i5 and record a branch\ntrace that incorporates the outer loop: {i5, i7, i1, i6, i7, i1, \u03b1}.\nLater, the program might take the other branch at i2 and then\nexit, recording another branch trace incorporating the outer loop:\n{i2, i4, i5, i7, i1, i6, i7, i1, \u03b1}. Thus, the outer loop is recorded and\ncompiled twice, and both copies must be retained in the trace cache.\n\ni2\ni3 i4\ni5\ni1\ni6\ni7\nt1\nt2\nTree\u2029Call\nOuter\u2029Tree\nNested\u2029Tree\nExit\u2029Guard\n(a) (b)\nFigure 7. Control \ufb02ow graph of a nested loop with an if statement\ninside the inner most loop (a). An inner tree captures the inner\nloop, and is nested inside an outer tree which \u201ccalls\u201d the inner tree.\nThe inner tree returns to the outer tree once it exits along its loop\ncondition guard (b).\nIn general, if loops are nested to depth k, and each loop has n paths\n(on geometric average), this na \u00a8\u0131ve strategy yields O(nk) traces,\nwhich can easily \ufb01ll the trace cache.\nIn order to execute programs with nested loops ef\ufb01ciently, a\ntracing system needs a technique for covering the nested loops with\nnative code without exponential trace duplication.\n4.1 Nesting Algorithm\nThe key insight is that if each loop is represented by its own trace\ntree, the code for each loop can be contained only in its own tree,\nand outer loop paths will not be duplicated. Another key fact is that\nwe are not tracing arbitrary bytecodes that might have irreduceable\ncontrol \ufb02ow graphs, but rather bytecodes produced by a compiler\nfor a language with structured control \ufb02ow. Thus, given two loop\nedges, the system can easily determine whether they are nested\nand which is the inner loop. Using this knowledge, the system can\ncompile inner and outer loops separately, and make the outer loop\u2019s\ntraces call the inner loop\u2019s trace tree.\nThe algorithm for building nested trace trees is as follows. We\nstart tracing at loop headers exactly as in the basic tracing system.\nWhen we exit a loop (detected by comparing the interpreter PC\nwith the range given by the loop edge), we stop the trace. The\nkey step of the algorithm occurs when we are recording a trace\nfor loop LR (R for loop being recorded) and we reach the header\nof a different loop LO (O for other loop). Note that LO must be an\ninner loop of LR because we stop the trace when we exit a loop.\n\u2022 If LO has a type-matching compiled trace tree, we call LO as\na nested trace tree. If the call succeeds, then we record the call\nin the trace for LR. On future executions, the trace for LR will\ncall the inner trace directly.\n\u2022 If LO does not have a type-matching compiled trace tree yet,\nwe have to obtain it before we are able to proceed. In order\nto do this, we simply abort recording the \ufb01rst trace. The trace\nmonitor will see the inner loop header, and will immediately\nstart recording the inner loop. 2\nIf all the loops in a nest are type-stable, then loop nesting creates\nno duplication. Otherwise, if loops are nested to a depth k, and each\n2 Instead of aborting the outer recording, we could principally merely sus-\npend the recording, but that would require the implementation to be able\nto record several traces simultaneously, complicating the implementation,\nwhile saving only a few iterations in the interpreter.\ni2\ni3\ni1\ni6\ni4\ni5\nt2\nt1\nt4\nExit\u2029Guard\nNested\u2029T ree\nFigure 8.

The outer tree calls\nthe two inner nested trace trees and places guards at their side exit\nlocations.\nloop is entered with m different type maps (on geometric average),\nthen we compile O(mk) copies of the innermost loop. As long as\nm is close to 1, the resulting trace trees will be tractable.\nAn important detail is that the call to the inner trace tree must act\nlike a function call site: it must return to the same point every time.\nThe goal of nesting is to make inner and outer loops independent;\nthus when the inner tree is called, it must exit to the same point\nin the outer tree every time with the same type map. Because we\ncannot actually guarantee this property, we must guard on it after\nthe call, and side exit if the property does not hold. A common\nreason for the inner tree not to return to the same point would\nbe if the inner tree took a new side exit for which it had never\ncompiled a trace. At this point, the interpreter PC is in the inner\ntree, so we cannot continue recording or executing the outer tree.\nIf this happens during recording, we abort the outer trace, to give\nthe inner tree a chance to \ufb01nish growing. A future execution of the\nouter tree would then be able to properly \ufb01nish and record a call to\nthe inner tree. If an inner tree side exit happens during execution of\na compiled trace for the outer tree, we simply exit the outer trace\nand start recording a new branch in the inner tree.\n4.2 Blacklisting with Nesting\nThe blacklisting algorithm needs modi\ufb01cation to work well with\nnesting. The problem is that outer loop traces often abort during\nstartup (because the inner tree is not available or takes a side exit),\nwhich would lead to their being quickly blacklisted by the basic\nalgorithm.\nThe key observation is that when an outer trace aborts because\nthe inner tree is not ready, this is probably a temporary condition.\nThus, we should not count such aborts toward blacklisting as long\nas we are able to build up more traces for the inner tree.\nIn our implementation, when an outer tree aborts on the inner\ntree, we increment the outer tree\u2019s blacklist counter as usual and\nback off on compiling it. When the inner tree \ufb01nishes a trace, we\ndecrement the blacklist counter on the outer loop, \u201cforgiving\u201d the\nouter loop for aborting previously. We also undo the backoff so that\nthe outer tree can start immediately trying to compile the next time\nwe reach it.\n5. Trace Tree Optimization\nThis section explains how a recorded trace is translated to an\noptimized machine code trace. The trace compilation subsystem,\nNANOJIT , is separate from the VM and can be used for other\napplications.\n\n5.1 Optimizations\nBecause traces are in SSA form and have no join points or \u03c6-\nnodes, certain optimizations are easy to implement. In order to\nget good startup performance, the optimizations must run quickly,\nso we chose a small set of optimizations. We implemented the\noptimizations as pipelined \ufb01lters so that they can be turned on and\noff independently, and yet all run in just two loop passes over the\ntrace: one forward and one backward.\nEvery time the trace recorder emits a LIR instruction, the in-\nstruction is immediately passed to the \ufb01rst \ufb01lter in the forward\npipeline. Thus, forward \ufb01lter optimizations are performed as the\ntrace is recorded. Each \ufb01lter may pass each instruction to the next\n\ufb01lter unchanged, write a different instruction to the next \ufb01lter, or\nwrite no instruction at all. For example, the constant folding \ufb01lter\ncan replace a multiply instruction like v13 := mul3, 1000 with a\nconstant instruction v13 = 3000.\nWe currently apply four forward \ufb01lters:\n\u2022 On ISAs without \ufb02oating-point instructions, a soft-\ufb02oat \ufb01lter\nconverts \ufb02oating-point LIR instructions to sequences of integer\ninstructions.\n\u2022 CSE (constant subexpression elimination),\n\u2022 expression simpli\ufb01cation, including constant folding and a few\nalgebraic identities (e.g., a \u2212 a = 0), and\n\u2022 source language semantic-speci\ufb01c expression simpli\ufb01cation,\nprimarily algebraic identities that allow DOUBLE to be replaced\nwith INT . For example, LIR that converts an INT to a DOUBLE\nand then back again would be removed by this \ufb01lter.\nWhen trace recording is completed, nanojit runs the backward\noptimization \ufb01lters. These are used for optimizations that require\nbackward program analysis. When running the backward \ufb01lters,\nnanojit reads one LIR instruction at a time, and the reads are passed\nthrough the pipeline.\nWe currently apply three backward \ufb01lters:\n\u2022 Dead data-stack store elimination. The LIR trace encodes many\nstores to locations in the interpreter stack. But these values are\nnever read back before exiting the trace (by the interpreter or\nanother trace). Thus, stores to the stack that are overwritten\nbefore the next exit are dead. Stores to locations that are off\nthe top of the interpreter stack at future exits are also dead.\n\u2022 Dead call-stack store elimination. This is the same optimization\nas above, except applied to the interpreter\u2019s call stack used for\nfunction call inlining.\n\u2022 Dead code elimination. This eliminates any operation that\nstores to a value that is never used.\nAfter a LIR instruction is successfully read (\u201cpulled\u201d) from\nthe backward \ufb01lter pipeline, nanojit\u2019s code generator emits native\nmachine instruction(s) for it.\n5.2 Register Allocation\nWe use a simple greedy register allocator that makes a single\nbackward pass over the trace (it is integrated with the code gen-\nerator). By the time the allocator has reached an instruction like\nv3 = add v1, v2, it has already assigned a register to v3. If v1 and\nv2 have not yet been assigned registers, the allocator assigns a free\nregister to each. If there are no free registers, a value is selected for\nspilling. We use a class heuristic that selects the \u201coldest\u201d register-\ncarried value (6).\nThe heuristic considers the set R of values v in registers imme-\ndiately after the current instruction for spilling. Let vm be the last\ninstruction before the current where each v is referred to. Then the\nTag JS Type Description\nxx1 number 31-bit integer representation\n000 object pointer to JSObject handle\n010 number pointer to double handle\n100 string pointer to JSString handle\n110 boolean enumeration for null, unde\ufb01ned, true, false\nnull, or\nunde\ufb01ned\nFigure 9. Tagged values in the SpiderMonkey JS interpreter.\nTesting tags, unboxing (extracting the untagged value) and boxing\n(creating tagged values) are signi\ufb01cant costs. Avoiding these costs\nis a key bene\ufb01t of tracing.\nheuristic selects v with minimum vm. The motivation is that this\nfrees up a register for as long as possible given a single spill.\nIf we need to spill a value vs at this point, we generate the\nrestore code just after the code for the current instruction. The\ncorresponding spill code is generated just after the last point where\nvs was used. The register that was assigned to vs is marked free for\nthe preceding code, because that register can now be used freely\nwithout affecting the following code\n6. Implementation\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we have im-\nplemented a trace-based dynamic compiler for the SpiderMonkey\nJavaScript Virtual Machine (4). SpiderMonkey is the JavaScript\nVM embedded in Mozilla\u2019s Firefox open-source web browser (2),\nwhich is used by more than 200 million users world-wide. The core\nof SpiderMonkey is a bytecode interpreter implemented in C++.\nIn SpiderMonkey, all JavaScript values are represented by the\ntype jsval. A jsval is machine word in which up to the 3 of the\nleast signi\ufb01cant bits are a type tag, and the remaining bits are data.\nSee Figure 6 for details. All pointers contained in jsvals point to\nGC-controlled blocks aligned on 8-byte boundaries.\nJavaScript object values are mappings of string-valued property\nnames to arbitrary values. They are represented in one of two ways\nin SpiderMonkey. Most objects are represented by a shared struc-\ntural description, called the object shape, that maps property names\nto array indexes using a hash table. The object stores a pointer to\nthe shape and the array of its own property values. Objects with\nlarge, unique sets of property names store their properties directly\nin a hash table.\nThe garbage collector is an exact, non-generational, stop-the-\nworld mark-and-sweep collector.\nIn the rest of this section we discuss key areas of the TraceMon-\nkey implementation.\n6.1 Calling Compiled Traces\nCompiled traces are stored in a trace cache , indexed by intepreter\nPC and type map. Traces are compiled so that they may be\ncalled as functions using standard native calling conventions (e.g.,\nFASTCALL on x86).\nThe interpreter must hit a loop edge and enter the monitor in\norder to call a native trace for the \ufb01rst time. The monitor computes\nthe current type map, checks the trace cache for a trace for the\ncurrent PC and type map, and if it \ufb01nds one, executes the trace.\nTo execute a trace, the monitor must build a trace activation\nrecord containing imported local and global variables, temporary\nstack space, and space for arguments to native calls. The local and\nglobal values are then copied from the interpreter state to the trace\nactivation record. Then, the trace is called like a normal C function\npointer.\n\nWhen a trace call returns, the monitor restores the interpreter\nstate. First, the monitor checks the reason for the trace exit and\napplies blacklisting if needed. Then, it pops or synthesizes inter-\npreter JavaScript call stack frames as needed. Finally, it copies the\nimported variables back from the trace activation record to the in-\nterpreter state.\nAt least in the current implementation, these steps have a non-\nnegligible runtime cost, so minimizing the number of interpreter-\nto-trace and trace-to-interpreter transitions is essential for perfor-\nmance. (see also Section 3.3). Our experiments (see Figure 12)\nshow that for programs we can trace well such transitions hap-\npen infrequently and hence do not contribute signi\ufb01cantly to total\nruntime. In a few programs, where the system is prevented from\nrecording branch traces for hot side exits by aborts, this cost can\nrise to up to 10% of total execution time.\n6.2 Trace Stitching\nTransitions from a trace to a branch trace at a side exit avoid the\ncosts of calling traces from the monitor, in a feature called trace\nstitching. At a side exit, the exiting trace only needs to write live\nregister-carried values back to its trace activation record. In our im-\nplementation, identical type maps yield identical activation record\nlayouts, so the trace activation record can be reused immediately\nby the branch trace.\nIn programs with branchy trace trees with small traces, trace\nstitching has a noticeable cost. Although writing to memory and\nthen soon reading back would be expected to have a high L1\ncache hit rate, for small traces the increased instruction count has\na noticeable cost. Also, if the writes and reads are very close\nin the dynamic instruction stream, we have found that current\nx86 processors often incur penalties of 6 cycles or more (e.g., if\nthe instructions use different base registers with equal values, the\nprocessor may not be able to detect that the addresses are the same\nright away).\nThe alternate solution is to recompile an entire trace tree, thus\nachieving inter-trace register allocation (10). The disadvantage is\nthat tree recompilation takes time quadratic in the number of traces.\nWe believe that the cost of recompiling a trace tree every time\na branch is added would be prohibitive. That problem might be\nmitigated by recompiling only at certain points, or only for very\nhot, stable trees.\nIn the future, multicore hardware is expected to be common,\nmaking background tree recompilation attractive. In a closely re-\nlated project (13) background recompilation yielded speedups of\nup to 1.25x on benchmarks with many branch traces. We plan to\napply this technique to TraceMonkey as future work.\n6.3 Trace Recording\nThe job of the trace recorder is to emit LIR with identical semantics\nto the currently running interpreter bytecode trace. A good imple-\nmentation should have low impact on non-tracing interpreter per-\nformance and a convenient way for implementers to maintain se-\nmantic equivalence.\nIn our implementation, the only direct modi\ufb01cation to the inter-\npreter is a call to the trace monitor at loop edges. In our benchmark\nresults (see Figure 12) the total time spent in the monitor (for all\nactivities) is usually less than 5%, so we consider the interpreter\nimpact requirement met. Incrementing the loop hit counter is ex-\npensive because it requires us to look up the loop in the trace cache,\nbut we have tuned our loops to become hot and trace very quickly\n(on the second iteration). The hit counter implementation could be\nimproved, which might give us a small increase in overall perfor-\nmance, as well as more \ufb02exibility with tuning hotness thresholds.\nOnce a loop is blacklisted we never call into the trace monitor for\nthat loop (see Section 3.3).\nRecording is activated by a pointer swap that sets the inter-\npreter\u2019s dispatch table to call a single \u201cinterrupt\u201d routine for ev-\nery bytecode. The interrupt routine \ufb01rst calls a bytecode-speci\ufb01c\nrecording routine. Then, it turns off recording if necessary (e.g.,\nthe trace ended). Finally, it jumps to the standard interpreter byte-\ncode implementation. Some bytecodes have effects on the type map\nthat cannot be predicted before executing the bytecode (e.g., call-\ning String.charCodeAt, which returns an integer or NaN if the\nindex argument is out of range). For these, we arrange for the inter-\npreter to call into the recorder again after executing the bytecode.\nSince such hooks are relatively rare, we embed them directly into\nthe interpreter, with an additional runtime check to see whether a\nrecorder is currently active.\nWhile separating the interpreter from the recorder reduces indi-\nvidual code complexity, it also requires careful implementation and\nextensive testing to achieve semantic equivalence.\nIn some cases achieving this equivalence is dif\ufb01cult since Spi-\nderMonkey follows a fat-bytecode design, which was found to be\nbene\ufb01cial to pure interpreter performance.\nIn fat-bytecode designs, individual bytecodes can implement\ncomplex processing (e.g., the getprop bytecode, which imple-\nments full JavaScript property value access, including special cases\nfor cached and dense array access).\nFat bytecodes have two advantages: fewer bytecodes means\nlower dispatch cost, and bigger bytecode implementations give the\ncompiler more opportunities to optimize the interpreter.\nFat bytecodes are a problem for TraceMonkey because they\nrequire the recorder to reimplement the same special case logic\nin the same way. Also, the advantages are reduced because (a)\ndispatch costs are eliminated entirely in compiled traces, (b) the\ntraces contain only one special case, not the interpreter\u2019s large\nchunk of code, and (c) TraceMonkey spends less time running the\nbase interpreter.\nOne way we have mitigated these problems is by implementing\ncertain complex bytecodes in the recorder as sequences of simple\nbytecodes. Expressing the original semantics this way is not too dif-\n\ufb01cult, and recording simple bytecodes is much easier. This enables\nus to retain the advantages of fat bytecodes while avoiding some of\ntheir problems for trace recording. This is particularly effective for\nfat bytecodes that recurse back into the interpreter, for example to\nconvert an object into a primitive value by invoking a well-known\nmethod on the object, since it lets us inline this function call.\nIt is important to note that we split fat opcodes into thinner op-\ncodes only during recording. When running purely interpretatively\n(i.e. code that has been blacklisted), the interpreter directly and ef-\n\ufb01ciently executes the fat opcodes.\n6.4 Preemption\nSpiderMonkey, like many VMs, needs to preempt the user program\nperiodically. The main reasons are to prevent in\ufb01nitely looping\nscripts from locking up the host system and to schedule GC.\nIn the interpreter, this had been implemented by setting a \u201cpre-\nempt now\u201d \ufb02ag that was checked on every backward jump. This\nstrategy carried over into TraceMonkey: the VM inserts a guard on\nthe preemption \ufb02ag at every loop edge. We measured less than a\n1% increase in runtime on most benchmarks for this extra guard.\nIn practice, the cost is detectable only for programs with very short\nloops.\nWe tested and rejected a solution that avoided the guards by\ncompiling the loop edge as an unconditional jump, and patching\nthe jump target to an exit routine when preemption is required.\nThis solution can make the normal case slightly faster, but then\npreemption becomes very slow. The implementation was also very\ncomplex, especially trying to restart execution after the preemption.\n\n6.5 Calling External Functions\nLike most interpreters, SpiderMonkey has a foreign function inter-\nface (FFI) that allows it to call C builtins and host system functions\n(e.g., web browser control and DOM access). The FFI has a stan-\ndard signature for JS-callable functions, the key argument of which\nis an array of boxed values. External functions called through the\nFFI interact with the program state through an interpreter API (e.g.,\nto read a property from an argument). There are also certain inter-\npreter builtins that do not use the FFI, but interact with the program\nstate in the same way, such as the CallIteratorNext function\nused with iterator objects. TraceMonkey must support this FFI in\norder to speed up code that interacts with the host system inside hot\nloops.\nCalling external functions from TraceMonkey is potentially dif-\n\ufb01cult because traces do not update the interpreter state until exit-\ning. In particular, external functions may need the call stack or the\nglobal variables, but they may be out of date.\nFor the out-of-date call stack problem, we refactored some of\nthe interpreter API implementation functions to re-materialize the\ninterpreter call stack on demand.\nWe developed a C++ static analysis and annotated some inter-\npreter functions in order to verify that the call stack is refreshed\nat any point it needs to be used. In order to access the call stack,\na function must be annotated as either F ORCES STACK or R E-\nQUIRES STACK. These annotations are also required in order to call\nREQUIRES STACK functions, which are presumed to access the call\nstack transitively. F ORCES STACK is a trusted annotation, applied\nto only 5 functions, that means the function refreshes the call stack.\nREQUIRES STACK is an untrusted annotation that means the func-\ntion may only be called if the call stack has already been refreshed.\nSimilarly, we detect when host functions attempt to directly\nread or write global variables, and force the currently running trace\nto side exit. This is necessary since we cache and unbox global\nvariables into the activation record during trace execution.\nSince both call-stack access and global variable access are\nrarely performed by host functions, performance is not signi\ufb01cantly\naffected by these safety mechanisms.\nAnother problem is that external functions can reenter the inter-\npreter by calling scripts, which in turn again might want to access\nthe call stack or global variables. To address this problem, we made\nthe VM set a \ufb02ag whenever the interpreter is reentered while a com-\npiled trace is running.\nEvery call to an external function then checks this \ufb02ag and exits\nthe trace immediately after returning from the external function call\nif it is set. There are many external functions that seldom or never\nreenter, and they can be called without problem, and will cause\ntrace exit only if necessary.\nThe FFI\u2019s boxed value array requirement has a performance\ncost, so we de\ufb01ned a new FFI that allows C functions to be an-\nnotated with their argument types so that the tracer can call them\ndirectly, without unnecessary argument conversions.\nCurrently, we do not support calling native property get and set\noverride functions or DOM functions directly from trace. Support\nis planned future work.\n6.6 Correctness\nDuring development, we had access to existing JavaScript test\nsuites, but most of them were not designed with tracing VMs in\nmind and contained few loops.\nOne tool that helped us greatly was Mozilla\u2019s JavaScript fuzz\ntester, JSFUNFUZZ , which generates random JavaScript programs\nby nesting random language elements. We modi\ufb01ed JSFUNFUZZ\nto generate loops, and also to test more heavily certain constructs\nwe suspected would reveal \ufb02aws in our implementation. For exam-\nple, we suspected bugs in TraceMonkey\u2019s handling of type-unstable\n!\"# $!\"# %!\"# &!\"# '!\"# (!\"# )!\"# *!\"# +!\"# ,!\"# $!!\"#\n&-./012#3%4%56#\n&-.789:;#3%4,56#\n&-.9<=>9</2#3$4%56#\n<//2??.1@A<9=.>922?#3!4,56#\n<//2??.B<AAC0/;#3%4%56#\n<//2??.A18-=#3'4%56#\n<//2??.A?@2D2#3&4!56#\n1@>8:?.&1@>.1@>?.@A.1=>2#3%(4(56#\n1@>8:?.1@>?.@A.1=>2#3+4*56#\n1@>8:?.1@>E@?2.<A-#3%(4%56#\n1@>8:?.A?@2D2.1@>?#3%4*56#\n/8A>98FG8E.92/09?@D2#3$4!56#\n/9=:>8.<2?#3$4)56#\n/9=:>8.7-(#3%4&56#\n/9=:>8.?;<$#3(4,56#\n-<>2.B897<>.>8H2#3$4$56#\n-<>2.B897<>.5:<91#3$4!56#\n7<>;./89-@/#3'4,56#\n7<>;.:<9I<F.?07?#3(4,56#\n7<>;.?:2/>9<F.A897#3*4$56#\n92J25:.-A<#3'4%56#\n?>9@AJ.1<?2)'#3%4(56#\n?>9@AJ.B<?><#3$4(56#\n?>9@AJ.><J/F80-#3$4$56#\n?>9@AJ.0A:</C./8-2#3$4%56#\n?>9@AJ.D<F@-<>2.@A:0>#3$4,56#\nKA>29:92># L<ID2#\nFigure 11.

The fraction of bytecodes exe-\ncuted while recording is too small to see in this \ufb01gure, except\nfor crypto-md5, where fully 3% of bytecodes are executed while\nrecording. In most of the tests, almost all the bytecodes are exe-\ncuted by compiled traces. Three of the benchmarks are not traced\nat all and run in the interpreter.\nloops and heavily branching code, and a specialized fuzz tester in-\ndeed revealed several regressions which we subsequently corrected.\n7. Evaluation\nWe evaluated our JavaScript tracing implementation using Sun-\nSpider, the industry standard JavaScript benchmark suite. SunSpi-\nder consists of 26 short-running (less than 250ms, average 26ms)\nJavaScript programs. This is in stark contrast to benchmark suites\nsuch as SpecJVM98 (3) used to evaluate desktop and server Java\nVMs. Many programs in those benchmarks use large data sets and\nexecute for minutes. The SunSpider programs carry out a variety of\ntasks, primarily 3d rendering, bit-bashing, cryptographic encoding,\nmath kernels, and string processing.\nAll experiments were performed on a MacBook Pro with 2.2\nGHz Core 2 processor and 2 GB RAM running MacOS 10.5.\nBenchmark results. The main question is whether programs\nrun faster with tracing. For this, we ran the standard SunSpider test\ndriver, which starts a JavaScript interpreter, loads and runs each\nprogram once for warmup, then loads and runs each program 10\ntimes and reports the average time taken by each. We ran 4 differ-\nent con\ufb01gurations for comparison: (a) SpiderMonkey, the baseline\ninterpreter, (b) TraceMonkey, (d) SquirrelFish Extreme (SFX), the\ncall-threaded JavaScript interpreter used in Apple\u2019s WebKit, and\n(e) V8, the method-compiling JavaScript VM from Google.\nFigure 10 shows the relative speedups achieved by tracing, SFX,\nand V8 against the baseline (SpiderMonkey). Tracing achieves the\nbest speedups in integer-heavy benchmarks, up to the 25x speedup\non bitops-bitwise-and.\nTraceMonkey is the fastest VM on 9 of the 26 benchmarks\n(3d-morph, bitops-3bit-bits-in-byte, bitops-bitwise-\nand, crypto-sha1, math-cordic, math-partial-sums, math-\nspectral-norm, string-base64, string-validate-input).\n\n!\"\n#\"\n$!\"\n$#\"\n%!\"\n%#\"\n&'()*+,\"\n-./\"\n01\"\nFigure 10. Speedup vs. a baseline JavaScript interpreter (SpiderMonkey) for our trace-based JIT compiler, Apple\u2019s SquirrelFish Extreme\ninline threading interpreter and Google\u2019s V8 JS compiler. Our system generates particularly ef\ufb01cient code for programs that bene\ufb01t most from\ntype specialization, which includes SunSpider Benchmark programs that perform bit manipulation. We type-specialize the code in question\nto use integer arithmetic, which substantially improves performance. For one of the benchmark programs we execute 25 times faster than\nthe SpiderMonkey interpreter, and almost 5 times faster than V8 and SFX. For a large number of benchmarks all three VMs produce similar\nresults. We perform worst on benchmark programs that we do not trace and instead fall back onto the interpreter. This includes the recursive\nbenchmarks access-binary-trees and control-flow-recursive, for which we currently don\u2019t generate any native code.\nIn particular, the bitops benchmarks are short programs that per-\nform many bitwise operations, so TraceMonkey can cover the en-\ntire program with 1 or 2 traces that operate on integers. TraceMon-\nkey runs all the other programs in this set almost entirely as native\ncode.\nregexp-dna is dominated by regular expression matching,\nwhich is implemented in all 3 VMs by a special regular expression\ncompiler. Thus, performance on this benchmark has little relation\nto the trace compilation approach discussed in this paper.\nTraceMonkey\u2019s smaller speedups on the other benchmarks can\nbe attributed to a few speci\ufb01c causes:\n\u2022 The implementation does not currently trace recursion, so\nTraceMonkey achieves a small speedup or no speedup on\nbenchmarks that use recursion extensively: 3d-cube, 3d-\nraytrace, access-binary-trees, string-tagcloud, and\ncontrolflow-recursive.\n\u2022 The implementation does not currently trace eval and some\nother functions implemented in C. Because date-format-\ntofte and date-format-xparb use such functions in their\nmain loops, we do not trace them.\n\u2022 The implementation does not currently trace through regular\nexpression replace operations. The replace function can be\npassed a function object used to compute the replacement text.\nOur implementation currently does not trace functions called\nas replace functions. The run time of string-unpack-code is\ndominated by such a replace call.\n\u2022 Two programs trace well, but have a long compilation time.\naccess-nbody forms a large number of traces (81). crypto-md5\nforms one very long trace. We expect to improve performance\non this programs by improving the compilation speed of nano-\njit.\n\u2022 Some programs trace very well, and speed up compared to\nthe interpreter, but are not as fast as SFX and/or V8, namely\nbitops-bits-in-byte, bitops-nsieve-bits, access-\nfannkuch, access-nsieve, and crypto-aes. The reason is\nnot clear, but all of these programs have nested loops with\nsmall bodies, so we suspect that the implementation has a rela-\ntively high cost for calling nested traces. string-fasta traces\nwell, but its run time is dominated by string processing builtins,\nwhich are unaffected by tracing and seem to be less ef\ufb01cient in\nSpiderMonkey than in the two other VMs.\nDetailed performance metrics.In Figure 11 we show the frac-\ntion of instructions interpreted and the fraction of instructions exe-\ncuted as native code. This \ufb01gure shows that for many programs, we\nare able to execute almost all the code natively.\nFigure 12 breaks down the total execution time into four activ-\nities: interpreting bytecodes while not recording, recording traces\n(including time taken to interpret the recorded trace), compiling\ntraces to native code, and executing native code traces.\nThese detailed metrics allow us to estimate parameters for a\nsimple model of tracing performance. These estimates should be\nconsidered very rough, as the values observed on the individual\nbenchmarks have large standard deviations (on the order of the\n\nLoops Trees Traces Aborts Flushes Trees/Loop Traces/Tree Traces/Loop Speedup\n3d-cube 25 27 29 3 0 1.1 1.1 1.2 2.20x\n3d-morph 5 8 8 2 0 1.6 1.0 1.6 2.86x\n3d-raytrace 10 25 100 10 1 2.5 4.0 10.0 1.18x\naccess-binary-trees 0 0 0 5 0 - - - 0.93x\naccess-fannkuch 10 34 57 24 0 3.4 1.7 5.7 2.20x\naccess-nbody 8 16 18 5 0 2.0 1.1 2.3 4.19x\naccess-nsieve 3 6 8 3 0 2.0 1.3 2.7 3.05x\nbitops-3bit-bits-in-byte 2 2 2 0 0 1.0 1.0 1.0 25.47x\nbitops-bits-in-byte 3 3 4 1 0 1.0 1.3 1.3 8.67x\nbitops-bitwise-and 1 1 1 0 0 1.0 1.0 1.0 25.20x\nbitops-nsieve-bits 3 3 5 0 0 1.0 1.7 1.7 2.75x\ncontrol\ufb02ow-recursive 0 0 0 1 0 - - - 0.98x\ncrypto-aes 50 72 78 19 0 1.4 1.1 1.6 1.64x\ncrypto-md5 4 4 5 0 0 1.0 1.3 1.3 2.30x\ncrypto-sha1 5 5 10 0 0 1.0 2.0 2.0 5.95x\ndate-format-tofte 3 3 4 7 0 1.0 1.3 1.3 1.07x\ndate-format-xparb 3 3 11 3 0 1.0 3.7 3.7 0.98x\nmath-cordic 2 4 5 1 0 2.0 1.3 2.5 4.92x\nmath-partial-sums 2 4 4 1 0 2.0 1.0 2.0 5.90x\nmath-spectral-norm 15 20 20 0 0 1.3 1.0 1.3 7.12x\nregexp-dna 2 2 2 0 0 1.0 1.0 1.0 4.21x\nstring-base64 3 5 7 0 0 1.7 1.4 2.3 2.53x\nstring-fasta 5 11 15 6 0 2.2 1.4 3.0 1.49x\nstring-tagcloud 3 6 6 5 0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.09x\nstring-unpack-code 4 4 37 0 0 1.0 9.3 9.3 1.20x\nstring-validate-input 6 10 13 1 0 1.7 1.3 2.2 1.86x\nFigure 13. Detailed trace recording statistics for the SunSpider benchmark set.\nmean). We exclude regexp-dna from the following calculations,\nbecause most of its time is spent in the regular expression matcher,\nwhich has much different performance characteristics from the\nother programs. (Note that this only makes a difference of about\n10% in the results.) Dividing the total execution time in processor\nclock cycles by the number of bytecodes executed in the base\ninterpreter shows that on average, a bytecode executes in about\n35 cycles. Native traces take about 9 cycles per bytecode, a 3.9x\nspeedup over the interpreter.\nUsing similar computations, we \ufb01nd that trace recording takes\nabout 3800 cycles per bytecode, and compilation 3150 cycles per\nbytecode. Hence, during recording and compiling the VM runs at\n1/200 the speed of the interpreter. Because it costs 6950 cycles to\ncompile a bytecode, and we save 26 cycles each time that code is\nrun natively, we break even after running a trace 270 times.\nThe other VMs we compared with achieve an overall speedup\nof 3.0x relative to our baseline interpreter. Our estimated native\ncode speedup of 3.9x is signi\ufb01cantly better. This suggests that\nour compilation techniques can generate more ef\ufb01cient native code\nthan any other current JavaScript VM.\nThese estimates also indicate that our startup performance could\nbe substantially better if we improved the speed of trace recording\nand compilation. The estimated 200x slowdown for recording and\ncompilation is very rough, and may be in\ufb02uenced by startup factors\nin the interpreter (e.g., caches that have not warmed up yet during\nrecording). One observation supporting this conjecture is that in\nthe tracer, interpreted bytecodes take about 180 cycles to run. Still,\nrecording and compilation are clearly both expensive, and a better\nimplementation, possibly including redesign of the LIR abstract\nsyntax or encoding, would improve startup performance.\nOur performance results con\ufb01rm that type specialization using\ntrace trees substantially improves performance. We are able to\noutperform the fastest available JavaScript compiler (V8) and the\nfastest available JavaScript inline threaded interpreter (SFX) on 9\nof 26 benchmarks.\n8. Related Work\nTrace optimization for dynamic languages.The closest area of\nrelated work is on applying trace optimization to type-specialize\ndynamic languages. Existing work shares the idea of generating\ntype-specialized code speculatively with guards along interpreter\ntraces.\nTo our knowledge, Rigo\u2019s Psyco (16) is the only published\ntype-specializing trace compiler for a dynamic language (Python).\nPsyco does not attempt to identify hot loops or inline function calls.\nInstead, Psyco transforms loops to mutual recursion before running\nand traces all operations.\nPall\u2019s LuaJIT is a Lua VM in development that uses trace com-\npilation ideas. (1). There are no publications on LuaJIT but the cre-\nator has told us that LuaJIT has a similar design to our system, but\nwill use a less aggressive type speculation (e.g., using a \ufb02oating-\npoint representation for all number values) and does not generate\nnested traces for nested loops.\nGeneral trace optimization. General trace optimization has\na longer history that has treated mostly native code and typed\nlanguages like Java. Thus, these systems have focused less on type\nspecialization and more on other optimizations.\nDynamo (7) by Bala et al, introduced native code tracing as a\nreplacement for pro\ufb01le-guided optimization (PGO). A major goal\nwas to perform PGO online so that the pro\ufb01le was speci\ufb01c to\nthe current execution. Dynamo used loop headers as candidate hot\ntraces, but did not try to create loop traces speci\ufb01cally.\nTrace trees were originally proposed by Gal et al. (11) in the\ncontext of Java, a statically typed language. Their trace trees ac-\ntually inlined parts of outer loops within the inner loops (because\n\n!\"# $!\"# %!\"# &!\"# '!\"# (!!\"#\n)*+,-./#0$1$23#\n)*+45678#0$1923#\n)*+6:;<6:,/#0(1$23#\n:,,/==+.>?:6;+<6//=#0!1923#\n:,,/==+@:??A-,8#0$1$23#\n:,,/==+?.5*;#0%1$23#\n:,,/==+?=>/B/#0)1!23#\n.><57=+).><+.><=+>?+.;</#0$C1C23#\n.><57=+.><=+>?+.;</#0'1D23#\n.><57=+.><E>=/+:?*#0$C1$23#\n.><57=+?=>/B/+.><=#0$1D23#\n,5?<65FG5E+6/,-6=>B/#0(1!23#\n,6;7<5+:/=#0(1&23#\n,6;7<5+4*C#0$1)23#\n,6;7<5+=8:(#0C1923#\n*:</+@564:<+<5H/#0(1(23#\n*:</+@564:<+27:6.#0(1!23#\n4:<8+,56*>,#0%1923#\n4:<8+7:6I:F+=-4=#0C1923#\n4:<8+=7/,<6:F+?564#0D1(23#\n6/J/27+*?:#0%1$23#\n=<6>?J+.:=/&%#0$1C23#\n=<6>?J+@:=<:#0(1C23#\n=<6>?J+<:J,F5-*#0(1(23#\n=<6>?J+-?7:,A+,5*/#0(1$23#\n=<6>?J+B:F>*:</+>?7-<#0(1923#\nK?</676/<#\n L5?><56# M/,56*#\n N547>F/# N:FF#O6:,/# M-?#O6:,/#\nFigure 12. Fraction of time spent on major VM activities.The\nspeedup vs. interpreter is shown in parentheses next to each test.\nMost programs where the VM spends the majority of its time run-\nning native code have a good speedup. Recording and compilation\ncosts can be substantial; speeding up those parts of the implemen-\ntation would improve SunSpider performance.\ninner loops become hot \ufb01rst), leading to much greater tail duplica-\ntion.\nYETI, from Zaleski et al. (19) applied Dynamo-style tracing\nto Java in order to achieve inlining, indirect jump elimination,\nand other optimizations. Their primary focus was on designing an\ninterpreter that could easily be gradually re-engineered as a tracing\nVM.\nSuganuma et al. (18) described region-based compilation (RBC),\na relative of tracing. A region is an subprogram worth optimizing\nthat can include subsets of any number of methods. Thus, the com-\npiler has more \ufb02exibility and can potentially generate better code,\nbut the pro\ufb01ling and compilation systems are correspondingly more\ncomplex.\nType specialization for dynamic languages.Dynamic lan-\nguage implementors have long recognized the importance of type\nspecialization for performance. Most previous work has focused on\nmethods instead of traces.\nChambers et. al (9) pioneered the idea of compiling multiple\nversions of a procedure specialized for the input types in the lan-\nguage Self. In one implementation, they generated a specialized\nmethod online each time a method was called with new input types.\nIn another, they used an of\ufb02ine whole-program static analysis to\ninfer input types and constant receiver types at call sites. Interest-\ningly, the two techniques produced nearly the same performance.\nSalib (17) designed a type inference algorithm for Python based\non the Cartesian Product Algorithm and used the results to special-\nize on types and translate the program to C++.\nMcCloskey (14) has work in progress based on a language-\nindependent type inference that is used to generate ef\ufb01cient C\nimplementations of JavaScript and Python programs.\nNative code generation by interpreters.The traditional inter-\npreter design is a virtual machine that directly executes ASTs or\nmachine-code-like bytecodes. Researchers have shown how to gen-\nerate native code with nearly the same structure but better perfor-\nmance.\nCall threading, also known as context threading (8), compiles\nmethods by generating a native call instruction to an interpreter\nmethod for each interpreter bytecode. A call-return pair has been\nshown to be a potentially much more ef\ufb01cient dispatch mechanism\nthan the indirect jumps used in standard bytecode interpreters.\nInline threading (15) copies chunks of interpreter native code\nwhich implement the required bytecodes into a native code cache,\nthus acting as a simple per-method JIT compiler that eliminates the\ndispatch overhead.\nNeither call threading nor inline threading perform type special-\nization.\nApple\u2019s SquirrelFish Extreme (5) is a JavaScript implementa-\ntion based on call threading with selective inline threading. Com-\nbined with ef\ufb01cient interpreter engineering, these threading tech-\nniques have given SFX excellent performance on the standard Sun-\nSpider benchmarks.\nGoogle\u2019s V8 is a JavaScript implementation primarily based\non inline threading, with call threading only for very complex\noperations.\n9. Conclusions\nThis paper described how to run dynamic languages ef\ufb01ciently by\nrecording hot traces and generating type-specialized native code.\nOur technique focuses on aggressively inlined loops, and for each\nloop, it generates a tree of native code traces representing the\npaths and value types through the loop observed at run time. We\nexplained how to identify loop nesting relationships and generate\nnested traces in order to avoid excessive code duplication due\nto the many paths through a loop nest. We described our type\nspecialization algorithm. We also described our trace compiler,\nwhich translates a trace from an intermediate representation to\noptimized native code in two linear passes.\nOur experimental results show that in practice loops typically\nare entered with only a few different combinations of value types\nof variables. Thus, a small number of traces per loop is suf\ufb01cient\nto run a program ef\ufb01ciently. Our experiments also show that on\nprograms amenable to tracing, we achieve speedups of 2x to 20x.\n10. Future Work\nWork is underway in a number of areas to further improve the\nperformance of our trace-based JavaScript compiler. We currently\ndo not trace across recursive function calls, but plan to add the\nsupport for this capability in the near term. We are also exploring\nadoption of the existing work on tree recompilation in the context\nof the presented dynamic compiler in order to minimize JIT pause\ntimes and obtain the best of both worlds, fast tree stitching as well\nas the improved code quality due to tree recompilation.\nWe also plan on adding support for tracing across regular ex-\npression substitutions using lambda functions, function applica-\ntions and expression evaluation using eval. All these language\nconstructs are currently executed via interpretation, which limits\nour performance for applications that use those features.\nAcknowledgments\nParts of this effort have been sponsored by the National Science\nFoundation under grants CNS-0615443 and CNS-0627747, as well\nas by the California MICRO Program and industrial sponsor Sun\nMicrosystems under Project No. 07-127.\nThe U.S. Government is authorized to reproduce and distribute\nreprints for Governmental purposes notwithstanding any copyright\nannotation thereon.

electric vehicles For an infrastructure system of charging stations, see Electric vehicle charging network . Not to be confused with filling station or car charger . \"Charge point\" redirects here. For the company, see ChargePoint . Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage. [ 28 ] Connectors [ edit ] Common charging connectors IEC Type 4 / CHAdeMO (left); CCS Combo 2 (center); IEC Type 2 outlet (right) IEC Type 1 / SAE J1772 inlet (left); NACS (center); IEC Type 2 connector outlet (right) Common connectors include Type 1 (Yazaki) , Type 2 (Mennekes) , CCS Combo 1 and 2 , CHAdeMO , and Tesla. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle. ^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

Not to be confused with filling station or car charger . \"Charge point\" redirects here. For the company, see ChargePoint . Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all.

Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Electric vehicle charging station ) Installation for charging electric vehicles For an infrastructure system of charging stations, see Electric vehicle charging network . Not to be confused with filling station or car charger . \"Charge point\" redirects here. For the company, see ChargePoint . Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage. [ 28 ] Connectors [ edit ] Common charging connectors IEC Type 4 / CHAdeMO (left); CCS Combo 2 (center); IEC Type 2 outlet (right) IEC Type 1 / SAE J1772 inlet (left); NACS (center); IEC Type 2 connector outlet (right) Common connectors include Type 1 (Yazaki) , Type 2 (Mennekes) , CCS Combo 1 and 2 , CHAdeMO , and Tesla. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle. ^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

electric vehicles For an infrastructure system of charging stations, see Electric vehicle charging network . Not to be confused with filling station or car charger . \"Charge point\" redirects here. For the company, see ChargePoint . Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage. [ 28 ] Connectors [ edit ] Common charging connectors IEC Type 4 / CHAdeMO (left); CCS Combo 2 (center); IEC Type 2 outlet (right) IEC Type 1 / SAE J1772 inlet (left); NACS (center); IEC Type 2 connector outlet (right) Common connectors include Type 1 (Yazaki) , Type 2 (Mennekes) , CCS Combo 1 and 2 , CHAdeMO , and Tesla. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle. ^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

Not to be confused with filling station or car charger . \"Charge point\" redirects here. For the company, see ChargePoint . Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all.

Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle. ^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power.\nCharging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards.\nPublic charging stations [ edit ]\nPublic charging stations\nPublic charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.\nStandards [ edit ]\nStandards\nMultiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ]\nNomenclature [ edit ]\nNomenclature\nIn 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ]\nSocket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle\nPlug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached.\nCable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle\nConnector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet\nVehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power\nThe terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ]\nTesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ]\nVoltage and power [ edit ]\nVoltage and power\nEarly standards [ edit ]\nThe National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9\nUnder the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9\nLevel 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18\nLevel 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9\nSAE [ edit ]\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power.\nAlternating current (AC) [ edit ]\nAC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ]\nAC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit.\nAC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging.\nDirect current (DC) [ edit ]\nCommonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]\nDC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V.\nDC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V.\nAdditional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices).\nIEC [ edit ]\nIn 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation.\nThe IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1):\nMode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC)\nMode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems)\nMode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2)\nMode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO )\nThe connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1):\nCase A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2.\nCase B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3.\nCase C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4.\nTesla NACS [ edit ]\nMain article: North American Charging System\nThe North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality.\nAs of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ]\nTo meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ]\nFuture development [ edit ]\nAn extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ]\nA connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3\nWith support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2.\nThe CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated:\nThe broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ]\nHistorical connectors [ edit ]\nIn the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311\nMagne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26\nThe influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete.

Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80%\nSolaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station\n\nSolaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station\nCharging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ]\nThe California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ]\nCharge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ]\nCharging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}}\nThe effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller .\nBattery capacity [ edit ]\nBattery capacity\nThe usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ]\nAC-to-DC conversion [ edit ]\nAC-to-DC conversion\nBatteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.\nSafety [ edit ]\nSafety\nA Sunwin electric bus in Shanghai at a charging station\n\nA Sunwin electric bus in Shanghai at a charging station\nA battery electric bus charging station in Geneva , Switzerland\n\nA battery electric bus charging station in Geneva , Switzerland\nCharging stations are usually accessible to multiple electric vehicles and are equipped with current or connection sensing mechanisms to disconnect the power when the EV is not charging.\nThe two main types of safety sensors:\nCurrent sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ]\nSensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings.\nSensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed.\nPublic charging stations over the world [ edit ]\nPublic charging stations over the world\nFurther information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network\n\nThis section needs to be updated .

In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ]\nCharging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ]\nCharging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ]\nAs of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ]\nAsia/Pacific [ edit ]\nAsia/Pacific\nAs of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ]\nAs of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ]\nIn India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ]\nCompared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ]\nNorth America [ edit ]\nNorth America\nAs of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ]\nAs of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ]\nAs of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ]\nColder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ]\nAs of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ]\nOther charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card.\nIn June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ]\nAfrica [ edit ]\nAfrica\nSouth African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ]\nSouth America [ edit ]\nSouth America\nIn April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ]\nProjects [ edit ]\nProjects\nMain article: Electric vehicle network\nElectric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations.\nThe EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ]\nHome chargers [ edit ]\nHome chargers\nSee also: NEMA connector\nOver 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging.\nTo address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements.\nCharging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience.\nBattery swap [ edit ]\nBattery swap\nMain article: Battery swapping\nA battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ]\nHistory [ edit ]\nHistory\nThe concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres).\nBeginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ]\nBetter Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications.\nIn 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ]\nBenefits [ edit ]\nBenefits\nThe following benefits were claimed for battery swapping:\n\"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ]\nAutomation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ]\nSwitch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ]\nSpare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ]\nProviders [ edit ]\nProviders\nThe Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ]\nBetter Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ]\nIn June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ]\nBy 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ]\nSites [ edit ]\nSites\nUnlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking .\nPrivate locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ]\nPublic stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ]\nPublic charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used.\nWireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging station\n\nWireless charging station\nDetail of a wireless inductive charging device\n\nDetail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways.\nMobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery.\nAn offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ]\nRelated technologies [ edit ]\nRelated technologies\nSmart grid [ edit ]\nSmart grid\nA smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment.\nRenewable energy [ edit ]\nRenewable energy\nSee also: Solar vehicle\n\nThis section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 )\nElectric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ]\nCharging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ]\nTesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching.\nThe E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ]\nIn 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ]\n\nIn 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ]\nAlternative technologies [ edit ]\nAlternative technologies\nAlong a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver.\nThis allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle. ^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle. ^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle.\n^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

charging stations, see Electric vehicle charging network . Not to be confused with filling station or car charger . \"Charge point\" redirects here. For the company, see ChargePoint . Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation.

Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all.

Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete.

Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging. Charging time for 100\u00a0km (62 miles) of range on a 2020 Tesla Model S Long Range per EPA (111 MPGe / 188 Wh/km) [ 52 ] Configuration Voltage Current Power Charging time Comment Single-phase AC 120 V 12 A 1.44 kW 13 hours This is the maximum continuous power available from a standard US/Canadian 120 V 15 A circuit Single-phase AC 230 V 16 A 3.68 kW 5.1 hours This is the maximum continuous power available from a CEE 7/3 (\"Schuko\") receptacle on a 16 A rated circuit Single-phase AC 240 V 30 A 7.20 kW 2.6 hours Common maximum limit of public AC charging stations used in North America, such as a ChargePoint CT4000 Three-phase AC 400 V 16 A 11.0 kW 1.7 hours Maximum limit of a European 16 A three-phase AC charging station Three-phase AC 400 V 32 A 22.1 kW 51 minutes Maximum limit of a European 32 A three-phase AC charging station DC 400 V 125 A 50 kW 22 minutes Typical mid-power DC charging station DC 400 V 300 A 120 kW 9 minutes Typical power from a Tesla V2 Tesla Supercharger Safety [ edit ] A Sunwin electric bus in Shanghai at a charging station A battery electric bus charging station in Geneva , Switzerland Charging stations are usually accessible to multiple electric vehicles and are equipped with current or connection sensing mechanisms to disconnect the power when the EV is not charging. The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle. ^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all.

charging stations, see Electric vehicle charging network . Not to be confused with filling station or car charger . \"Charge point\" redirects here. For the company, see ChargePoint . Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all.

Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle. ^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all.

Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power.\nCharging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards.\nPublic charging stations [ edit ]\nPublic charging stations\nPublic charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.\nStandards [ edit ]\nStandards\nMultiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ]\nNomenclature [ edit ]\nNomenclature\nIn 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ]\nSocket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle\nPlug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached.\nCable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle\nConnector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet\nVehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power\nThe terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ]\nTesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ]\nVoltage and power [ edit ]\nVoltage and power\nEarly standards [ edit ]\nThe National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9\nUnder the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9\nLevel 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18\nLevel 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9\nSAE [ edit ]\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power.\nAlternating current (AC) [ edit ]\nAC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ]\nAC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit.\nAC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging.\nDirect current (DC) [ edit ]\nCommonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]\nDC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V.\nDC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V.\nAdditional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices).\nIEC [ edit ]\nIn 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation.\nThe IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1):\nMode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC)\nMode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems)\nMode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2)\nMode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO )\nThe connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1):\nCase A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2.\nCase B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3.\nCase C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4.\nTesla NACS [ edit ]\nMain article: North American Charging System\nThe North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality.\nAs of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ]\nTo meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ]\nFuture development [ edit ]\nAn extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ]\nA connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3\nWith support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 32 ]\n^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use.\nCCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2.\nThe CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated:\nThe broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ]\nHistorical connectors [ edit ]\nIn the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311\nMagne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26\nThe influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete.

Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80%\nSolaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station\n\nSolaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station\nCharging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ]\nThe California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ]\nCharge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ]\nCharging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}}\nThe effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller .\nBattery capacity [ edit ]\nBattery capacity\nThe usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ]\nAC-to-DC conversion [ edit ]\nAC-to-DC conversion\nBatteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.\nSafety [ edit ]\nSafety\nA Sunwin electric bus in Shanghai at a charging station\n\nA Sunwin electric bus in Shanghai at a charging station\nA battery electric bus charging station in Geneva , Switzerland\n\nA battery electric bus charging station in Geneva , Switzerland\nCharging stations are usually accessible to multiple electric vehicles and are equipped with current or connection sensing mechanisms to disconnect the power when the EV is not charging.\nThe two main types of safety sensors:\nCurrent sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ]\nSensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings.\nSensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed.\nPublic charging stations over the world [ edit ]\nPublic charging stations over the world\nFurther information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network\n\nThis section needs to be updated .

In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ]\nCharging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ]\nCharging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ]\nAs of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ]\nAsia/Pacific [ edit ]\nAsia/Pacific\nAs of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ]\nAs of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ]\nIn India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ]\nCompared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ]\nNorth America [ edit ]\nNorth America\nAs of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ]\nAs of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ]\nAs of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ]\nColder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ]\nAs of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ]\nOther charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card.\nIn June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ]\nAfrica [ edit ]\nAfrica\nSouth African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ]\nSouth America [ edit ]\nSouth America\nIn April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ]\nProjects [ edit ]\nProjects\nMain article: Electric vehicle network\nElectric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations.\nThe EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ]\nHome chargers [ edit ]\nHome chargers\nSee also: NEMA connector\nOver 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging.\nTo address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements.\nCharging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience.\nBattery swap [ edit ]\nBattery swap\nMain article: Battery swapping\nA battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ]\nHistory [ edit ]\nHistory\nThe concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres).\nBeginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ]\nBetter Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications.\nIn 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ]\nBenefits [ edit ]\nBenefits\nThe following benefits were claimed for battery swapping:\n\"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ]\nAutomation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ]\nSwitch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ]\nSpare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ]\nProviders [ edit ]\nProviders\nThe Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ]\nBetter Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ]\nIn June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ]\nBy 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ]\nSites [ edit ]\nSites\nUnlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking .\nPrivate locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ]\nPublic stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ]\nPublic charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used.\nWireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging station\n\nWireless charging station\nDetail of a wireless inductive charging device\n\nDetail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways.\nMobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery.\nAn offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ]\nRelated technologies [ edit ]\nRelated technologies\nSmart grid [ edit ]\nSmart grid\nA smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment.\nRenewable energy [ edit ]\nRenewable energy\nSee also: Solar vehicle\n\nThis section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 )\nElectric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ]\nCharging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ]\nTesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching.\nThe E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ]\nIn 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ]\n\nIn 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ]\nAlternative technologies [ edit ]\nAlternative technologies\nAlong a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver.\nThis allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle. ^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle.\n^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

electric vehicles For an infrastructure system of charging stations, see Electric vehicle charging network . Not to be confused with filling station or car charger . \"Charge point\" redirects here. For the company, see ChargePoint . Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage. [ 28 ] Connectors [ edit ] Common charging connectors IEC Type 4 / CHAdeMO (left); CCS Combo 2 (center); IEC Type 2 outlet (right) IEC Type 1 / SAE J1772 inlet (left); NACS (center); IEC Type 2 connector outlet (right) Common connectors include Type 1 (Yazaki) , Type 2 (Mennekes) , CCS Combo 1 and 2 , CHAdeMO , and Tesla. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle. ^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all.

Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Electric vehicle supply equipment ) Installation for charging electric vehicles For an infrastructure system of charging stations, see Electric vehicle charging network . Not to be confused with filling station or car charger . \"Charge point\" redirects here. For the company, see ChargePoint . Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage. [ 28 ] Connectors [ edit ] Common charging connectors IEC Type 4 / CHAdeMO (left); CCS Combo 2 (center); IEC Type 2 outlet (right) IEC Type 1 / SAE J1772 inlet (left); NACS (center); IEC Type 2 connector outlet (right) Common connectors include Type 1 (Yazaki) , Type 2 (Mennekes) , CCS Combo 1 and 2 , CHAdeMO , and Tesla. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out.

In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle. ^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

electric vehicles For an infrastructure system of charging stations, see Electric vehicle charging network . Not to be confused with filling station or car charger . \"Charge point\" redirects here. For the company, see ChargePoint . Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage. [ 28 ] Connectors [ edit ] Common charging connectors IEC Type 4 / CHAdeMO (left); CCS Combo 2 (center); IEC Type 2 outlet (right) IEC Type 1 / SAE J1772 inlet (left); NACS (center); IEC Type 2 connector outlet (right) Common connectors include Type 1 (Yazaki) , Type 2 (Mennekes) , CCS Combo 1 and 2 , CHAdeMO , and Tesla. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all.

Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle. ^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

Not to be confused with filling station or car charger . \"Charge point\" redirects here. For the company, see ChargePoint . Charging stations for electric vehicles : Top-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city , Japan. Top-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point. Bottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas. Bottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009). A charging station , also known as a charge point , chargepoint , or electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles , electric trucks , electric buses , neighborhood electric vehicles , and plug-in hybrid vehicles ). There are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations [ edit ] Fred Meyer parking area Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. Standards [ edit ] Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Charging station and vehicle terminology In 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ] Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached. Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power The terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ] Tesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ] Voltage and power [ edit ] Early standards [ edit ] NEC(1999) levels [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) Level 1 ( 1-phase AC) 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 24 120 2.88 Level 2 (1-phase AC) 32 208/240 7.68 Level 3 ( 3-phase AC) 400 480 332.6 The National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18 Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 SAE [ edit ] SAE J1772(2017) levels [ 7 ] Method Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) AC Level 1 12 120 1.44 16 120 1.92 AC Level 2 80 208\u2013240 19.2 DC Level 1 80 50\u20131000 80 DC Level 2 400 50\u20131000 400 The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. Alternating current (AC) [ edit ] AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ] AC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit. AC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging. Direct current (DC) [ edit ] Commonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] DC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V. DC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V. Additional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices). IEC [ edit ] In 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation. IEC 61851-1 modes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Mode Type Maximum supply Current (A) Voltage (V) Power (kW) 1 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 250 4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 16 480 11 2 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 250 7.4 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 32 480 22 3 1\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 250 14.5 3\u03a6\u00a0AC 63 480 43.5 4 DC 200 400 80 The IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1): Mode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC) Mode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems) Mode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2) Mode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO ) The connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1): Case A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2. Case B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3. Case C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4. Tesla NACS [ edit ] Main article: North American Charging System The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. As of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ] To meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ] Future development [ edit ] An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ] A connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3 With support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196 -2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power): Type 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications Type 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 , SAE J3068 , and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications Type 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal Type 4: DC fast-charge couplers Configuration AA: CHAdeMO Configuration BB: GB/T 20234.3 Configurations CC/DD: (reserved) Configuration EE: CCS Combo 1 Configuration FF: CCS Combo 2 Connector designs listed in IEC 62196 -2 and -3 [ a ] Power supply United States European Union Japan China 1-phase AC (62196.2) Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 [ b ] [ c ] Type 1 ( SAE J1772 ) Type 2 ( GB/T 20234.2 ) [ d ] 3-phase AC (62196.2) Type 2 ( SAE J3068 ) \u2014 DC (62196.3) EE ( CCS Combo 1) FF ( CCS Combo 2) [ c ] AA ( CHAdeMO ) [ c ] BB ( GB/T 20234.3 ) [ b ] ChaoJi (planned) Quick Notes on EV Charger types Notes ^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard ^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3). [ 33 ] ^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW). [ 32 ] ^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use. CCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2. The CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated: The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ] Historical connectors [ edit ] Public charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport . Shown are two obsolete 6 kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON). In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311 Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26 The influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete. [ 43 ] Charging time [ edit ] BYD e6 . Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80% Solaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station Charging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ] The California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ] Charge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ] Charging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}} The effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller . Battery capacity [ edit ] The usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ] AC-to-DC conversion [ edit ] Batteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.

The two main types of safety sensors: Current sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ] Sensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. Public charging stations over the world [ edit ] Further information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( February 2023 ) Public charging station signs US traffic sign Public-domain international sign Longer drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ] Charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ] Charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ] Asia/Pacific [ edit ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ] As of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ] In India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ] Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ] North America [ edit ] As of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ] As of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ] As of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ] Colder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ] As of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ] Other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. In June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ] Africa [ edit ] BMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg , South Africa (2021) South African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ] South America [ edit ] In April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ] Projects [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle network Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. The EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Home chargers [ edit ] See also: NEMA connector NEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes Over 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging. To address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. Charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. Battery swap [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping A battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ] History [ edit ] The concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres). Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ] Better Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. In 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ] Benefits [ edit ] The following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: \"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Automation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ] Switch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ] Spare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ] Providers [ edit ] A Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing The Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] In June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ] By 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ] Sites [ edit ] Car connected to an EV charger over a parking space Unlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking . Private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ] Public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ] Public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used. Wireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device Wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. Mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery. An offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ] Related technologies [ edit ] Smart grid [ edit ] A smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment. Renewable energy [ edit ] See also: Solar vehicle This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) Electric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ] Charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] Tesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. Several Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012) The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ] In 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ] In 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ] Alternative technologies [ edit ] Along a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. This allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all.

Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power.\nCharging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards.\nPublic charging stations [ edit ]\nPublic charging stations\nPublic charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.\nStandards [ edit ]\nStandards\nMultiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012. [ 1 ]\nNomenclature [ edit ]\nNomenclature\nIn 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms: [ 2 ]\nSocket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle\nPlug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached.\nCable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle\nConnector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet\nVehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power\nThe terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\". [ 3 ]\nTesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE. [ 4 ]\nVoltage and power [ edit ]\nVoltage and power\nEarly standards [ edit ]\nThe National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States; [ 6 ] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook. [ 5 ] :\u200a9\nUnder the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5 -20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A. [ 5 ] :\u200a9\nLevel 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit. [ 5 ] :\u200a9 For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector ( Avcon ). [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18\nLevel 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers. [ 5 ] :\u200a9\nSAE [ edit ]\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International ) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772 , initially developed in 2001. [ 8 ] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power.\nAlternating current (AC) [ edit ]\nAC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply. [ 8 ]\nAC Level 1 : Connects directly to a standard 120 V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316 A (0.7\u20131.92 kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit.\nAC Level 2 : Uses 240 V (single phase) or 208 V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80 A (1.4\u201319.2 kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging.\nDirect current (DC) [ edit ]\nCommonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]\nDC Level 1 : Supplies a maximum of 80 kW at 50\u20131000 V.\nDC Level 2 : Supplies a maximum of 400 kW at 50\u20131000 V.\nAdditional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196 -2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices).\nIEC [ edit ]\nIn 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation.\nThe IEC alternatively defines charging in modes ( IEC 61851 -1):\nMode 1 : slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC)\nMode 2 : slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems)\nMode 3 : slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 -2)\nMode 4 : DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196 -3, such as CHAdeMO )\nThe connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1):\nCase A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2.\nCase B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3.\nCase C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4.\nTesla NACS [ edit ]\nMain article: North American Charging System\nThe North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality.\nAs of November 2023, automakers Ford , General Motors , Rivian , Volvo , Polestar , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Honda , Jaguar , Fisker , Hyundai , BMW , Toyota , Subaru , and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles. [ 18 ] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement. [ 19 ]\nTo meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points, [ 20 ] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480 V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers , which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average). [ 4 ]\nFuture development [ edit ]\nAn extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ( Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well , including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV), [ 21 ] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500 V and 0\u20133000 A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers. [ 22 ] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 V DC (optionally, 1500 V DC) and 3000 A continuous rating. [ 23 ]\nA connector design was selected in May 2019 [ 21 ] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors. [ 24 ] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] :\u200a3\nWith support from Portland General Electric , on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers . In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1 MW chargers once they are available. [ 27 ] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.

[ 32 ]\n^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use.\nCCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2.\nThe CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan , Mitsubishi , and Toyota , while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM , Ford , Volkswagen , BMW , and Hyundai . Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated:\nThe broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out. [ 34 ]\nHistorical connectors [ edit ]\nIn the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1 , Ford Ranger EV , and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ( Magne Charge ) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON ). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system. [ 5 ] :\u200a10\u201311\nMagne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV , but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter). [ 35 ] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :\u200a23 SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999. [ 37 ] :\u200a26\nThe influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability, [ 38 ] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March. [ 39 ] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria , and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler). [ 37 ] :\u200a22 The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States. [ 37 ] :\u200a25 [ 40 ] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America, [ 37 ] :\u200a22 based on environmental and durability testing. [ 41 ] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212). [ 42 ] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete.

Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80%\nSolaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station\n\nSolaris Urbino 12 electric , battery electric bus , inductive charging station\nCharging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power. [ 44 ] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid. [ 45 ]\nThe California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle , and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging. [ 46 ]\nCharge time can be calculated as: [ 47 ]\nCharging Time (h) = Battery capacity (kWh) Charging power (kW) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}}\nThe effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system , charging losses (which can be as high as 25% [ 48 ] ), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller .\nBattery capacity [ edit ]\nBattery capacity\nThe usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). [ citation needed ] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi). [ 49 ] As of 2022 [update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km). [ 50 ]\nAC-to-DC conversion [ edit ]\nAC-to-DC conversion\nBatteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137 kW, sufficient for overnight charging. [ 51 ] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+ kW) is necessary. [ citation needed ] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.\nSafety [ edit ]\nSafety\nA Sunwin electric bus in Shanghai at a charging station\n\nA Sunwin electric bus in Shanghai at a charging station\nA battery electric bus charging station in Geneva , Switzerland\n\nA battery electric bus charging station in Geneva , Switzerland\nCharging stations are usually accessible to multiple electric vehicles and are equipped with current or connection sensing mechanisms to disconnect the power when the EV is not charging.\nThe two main types of safety sensors:\nCurrent sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range. [ citation needed ]\nSensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings.\nSensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. [ citation needed ] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed.\nPublic charging stations over the world [ edit ]\nPublic charging stations over the world\nFurther information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle network\n\nThis section needs to be updated .

In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh. [ 53 ]\nCharging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network. [ 54 ] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid . [ 55 ]\nCharging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment. [ 56 ]\nAs of December\u00a02012 [update] , around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. [ 57 ] As of August\u00a02014 [update] , some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined. [ 59 ] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million. [ 60 ] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. [ 61 ]\nAsia/Pacific [ edit ]\nAsia/Pacific\nAs of December\u00a02012 [update] , Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers. [ 57 ] As of December\u00a02012 [update] , China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations. [ 57 ]\nAs of September\u00a02013 [update] , the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne , with around 30 stations (7 kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities. [ 62 ]\nIn India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.

[ 66 ] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations. [ 67 ] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ( DC ) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned , aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents. [ 68 ] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009. [ 69 ]\nCompared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe. [ 70 ] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million. [ 70 ] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles. [ 71 ]\nNorth America [ edit ]\nNorth America\nAs of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada. [ 72 ]\nAs of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. [ 72 ]\nAs of August\u00a02018 [update] , 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States, [ 73 ] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs). [ 76 ]\nColder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters . Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly. [ 77 ] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220 \u00b0C, further limiting their value. [ 78 ]\nAs of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers. [ 79 ]\nOther charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America , EVgo , ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi , BMW , Ford , Hyundai , Kia , Lucid Motors , Mercedes , Volkswagen , and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card.\nIn June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States. [ 80 ] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors. [ 81 ] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. [ 82 ] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built. [ 83 ]\nAfrica [ edit ]\nAfrica\nSouth African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW , Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide. [ 84 ]\nSouth America [ edit ]\nSouth America\nIn April 2017 YPF , the state-owned oil company of Argentina , reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory. [ 85 ]\nProjects [ edit ]\nProjects\nMain article: Electric vehicle network\nElectric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations.\nThe EV Plug Alliance [ 86 ] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members ( Schneider Electric , Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ]\nHome chargers [ edit ]\nHome chargers\nSee also: NEMA connector\nOver 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage. [ 90 ] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging.\nTo address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements.\nCharging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts, [ 91 ] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience.\nBattery swap [ edit ]\nBattery swap\nMain article: Battery swapping\nA battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications. [ 92 ]\nHistory [ edit ]\nHistory\nThe concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company , through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric . [ 93 ] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres).\nBeginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. [ 94 ] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics . [ 95 ]\nBetter Place , Tesla , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications.\nIn 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network. [ 1 ] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps. [ 98 ] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down. [ 99 ]\nBenefits [ edit ]\nBenefits\nThe following benefits were claimed for battery swapping:\n\"Refueling\" in under five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 101 ]\nAutomation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped. [ 102 ]\nSwitch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners. [ 103 ]\nSpare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services. [ 104 ]\nProviders [ edit ]\nProviders\nThe Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark. [ 105 ]\nBetter Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron , near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes. [ 100 ] [ 106 ] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. [ 107 ] [ 108 ]\nIn June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping . Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds. [ 101 ] [ 109 ] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced. [ 101 ] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest. [ 110 ]\nBy 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe, [ 111 ] up from 131 in 2020. [ 112 ]\nSites [ edit ]\nSites\nUnlike filling stations , which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking .\nPrivate locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels. [ 113 ] Residences are by far the most common charging location. [ 114 ] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit. [ 115 ] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet. [ 116 ] These cables may be wall mounted. [ citation needed ]\nPublic stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations. [ 117 ] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption. [ 118 ]\nPublic charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities. [ 119 ] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas , transit stations, and government offices. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Typically, AC Type 1 / Type 2 plugs are used.\nWireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging station Detail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging station\n\nWireless charging station\nDetail of a wireless inductive charging device\n\nDetail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways.\nMobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery.\nAn offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service , will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea. [ 122 ] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms , Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships. [ 122 ]\nRelated technologies [ edit ]\nRelated technologies\nSmart grid [ edit ]\nSmart grid\nA smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging. [ 123 ] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118 , which also provide protocols for automatic payment.\nRenewable energy [ edit ]\nRenewable energy\nSee also: Solar vehicle\n\nThis section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 )\nElectric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power. [ 126 ]\nCharging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes. [ 127 ] [ 128 ]\nTesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching.\nThe E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kW of solar power. [ 129 ]\nIn 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4 kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation. [ 130 ]\n\nIn 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station. [ 131 ]\nAlternative technologies [ edit ]\nAlternative technologies\nAlong a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden , which connects Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 , a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver.\nThis allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads. [ 132 ] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one, [ 133 ] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle. ^ \"Park and Ride Locations\" .

However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all.

[ 1 ] The name is an abbreviation of \"CHArge de MOve\" (which the organization translates as \"charge for moving\") and is derived from the Japanese phrase \" o CHA deMO ikaga desuka \" ( \u304a\u8336\u3067\u3082\u3044\u304b\u304c\u3067\u3059\u304b ), translating to English as \"How about a cup of tea?\", referring to the time it would take to charge a car. [ 1 ] It competes with the Combined Charging System (CCS), which since 2014 has been required on public charging infrastructure installed in the European Union , Tesla 's North American Charging System (NACS) used by its Supercharger network outside of Europe, and China's GB/T charging standard . As of 2022 [update] , CHAdeMO remains popular in Japan, but is being equipped on very few new cars sold in North America or Europe. First-generation CHAdeMO connectors deliver up to 62.5 kW by 500 V , 125 A direct current [ 2 ] through a proprietary electrical connector , adding about 120 kilometres (75\u00a0mi) of range in a half an hour. It has been included in several international vehicle charging standards. The second-generation specification allows for up to 400\u00a0kW by 1\u00a0kV, 400\u00a0A direct current. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The CHAdeMO Association is currently co-developing with China Electricity Council (CEC) the third-generation standard with the working name of \u201c ChaoJi \u201d that aims to deliver 900\u00a0kW. [ 5 ] The charging system is now considered outdated in the U.S, with the Nissan Leaf and the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV being the only models to use it in the country. History [ edit ] CHAdeMO connector (left), with the competing Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 2 connector (middle), and the AC Type 2 connector (right) CHAdeMO originated out of a charging system design from the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). TEPCO had been participating on numerous EV infrastructure trial projects between 2006 and 2009 in collaboration with Nissan , Mitsubishi , Fuji Heavy Industries (now Subaru ), and other manufacturers. [ 6 ] These trials resulted in TEPCO developing patented technology and a specification, [ 7 ] which would form the basis for the CHAdeMO. [ 8 ] The first commercial CHAdeMO charging infrastructure was commissioned in 2009 alongside the launch of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV . [ 9 ] In March 2010, TEPCO formed the CHAdeMO Association with Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Subaru. [ 10 ] They were later joined by Hitachi , Honda and Panasonic . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] CHAdeMO would be the first organization to propose a standardized DC fast charge system  to be shared across diverse EVs, regardless of their brands and models. CHAdeMO became a published international standard in 2014 when the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted IEC 61851 -23 for the charging system, IEC 61851 -24 for communication, and IEC 62196 -3 configuration AA for the connector. [ 13 ] Later that year, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (EN) added CHAdeMO as a published standard along with CCS Combo 2, followed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2016. [ 14 ] A major blow to the international adoption of CHAdeMO came in 2013 when European Commission designated the Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 2 as the mandated plug for DC high-power charging infrastructure in Europe. [ 15 ] While the European Parliament had contemplated transitioning out CHAdeMO infrastructure by January 2019, the final mandate only required that all publicly accessible chargers in the EU be equipped 'at least' with CCS Combo 2, allowing stations to offer multiple connector types. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] While CHAdeMO was the first fast-charging standard to see widespread deployment and remains widely equipped on vehicles sold in Japan, it has been losing market share in other countries. Honda was the first of the CHAdeMO Association members to stop equipping the connector on vehicles sold outside of Japan starting with the Clarity Electric in 2016. Nissan decided not to use CHAdeMO on its Ariya SUVs introduced in 2021 outside of Japan. Toyota and Subaru have also equipped their jointly developed bZ4X/Solterra with CCS connectors outside of Japan. As of June\u00a02022 [update] , the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV and Nissan Leaf are the only plug-in vehicles equipped with CHAdeMO for sale in North America. [ 18 ] As demand increased for EV charging services for Tesla vehicles after 2019, and prior to opening of the competing North American Charging System (NACS) in late 2022, several electric vehicle charging network operators had added some Tesla charging connector adapters to CHAdeMO-standard charging stations. These included, ONroute rest stop network in Ontario, Canada \u2014where a Tesla adaptor was permanently attached to a CHAdeMO connector on some 60 charge stations\u2014 [ 19 ] and REVEL opened a charging station in Brooklyn for a while after they were denied a license to operate a Tesla ride-hailing fleet in New York City. [ 20 ] Also, EVgo , added a few optional Tesla adaptors to CHAdeMO connectors as early as 2019. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Connector design [ edit ] CHAdeMO CHAdeMO electric vehicle connector Type Automotive power connector Production history Produced Since 2009 General specifications Diameter 70 millimetres (2.8\u00a0in) Pins 10 (1 reserved) Electrical Signal high-voltage DC Pinout Pinouts for CHAdeMO, looking at end of vehicle connector FG Ground reference for control lines SS1 / SS2 Charge sequence signal start/stop charging N/C (not connected) DCP Charging enable vehicle grants EVSE permission to connect power DC+ / DC- DC power supplied power PP Connector proximity detection charge interlock, disables drivetrain while connected C-H / C-L CAN bus communication with vehicle bus to establish operational parameters DC fast charge [ edit ] Most electric vehicles (EV) have an on-board charger that uses a full bridge rectifier to transform alternating current (AC) from the electrical grid to direct current (DC) suitable for recharging the EV's battery pack. [ 23 ] Most EVs are designed with limited AC input power, typically based on the available power of consumer outlets: for example, 240\u00a0V, 30\u00a0A in the United States and Japan; 240\u00a0V, 40\u00a0A in Canada; and 230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A or 3\u03c6 , 400\u00a0V, 32\u00a0A in Europe and Australia. AC chargers with higher limits have been specified, for example SAE J1772 -2009 has an option for 240\u00a0V, 80\u00a0A and VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 has a 3\u03c6, 400\u00a0V, 63\u00a0A. But these charger types have been rarely deployed. Cost and thermal issues limit how much power the rectifier can handle, so beyond approximately 240\u00a0V AC and 75\u00a0A it is better for an external charging station to deliver DC directly to the battery. For faster charging, dedicated DC chargers can be built in permanent locations and provided with high-current connections to the grid. Such high voltage and high-current charging is called a DC fast charge (DCFC) or DC quick charging (DCQC). [ 24 ] Connector protocols and history [ edit ] While the notion of shared off-board DC charging infrastructure, together with the charging system design for CHAdeMO came out of TEPCOs trials starting in 2006, the connector itself had been designed in 1993, and was specified by the 1993 Japan Electric Vehicle Standard (JEVS) G105-1993 from the JARI. [ 25 ] In addition to carrying power, the connector also makes a data connection using the CAN bus protocol. [ 26 ] This performs functions such as a safety interlock to avoid energizing the connector before it is safe (similar to SAE J1772 ), transmitting battery parameters to the charging station including when to stop charging (top battery percentage, usually 80%), target voltage, total battery capacity, and how the station should vary its output current while charging. [ 27 ] The first protocol issued was CHAdeMO 0.9, which offered maximum charging power of 62.5\u00a0kW (125\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC). Version 1.0 followed in 2012, enhancing vehicle protection, compatibility, and reliability. Version 1.1 (2015) allowed the current to dynamically change during charging; Version 1.2 (2017) increased maximum power to 200\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC). CHAdeMO published its protocol for 400\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 1\u00a0kV) 'ultra-fast' charging in May 2018 as CHAdeMO 2.0. [ 28 ] CHAdeMO 2.0 allowed the standard to better compete with the CCS 'ultra-fast' stations being built around the world as part of new networks such as IONITY charging consortium. [ 29 ] Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) [ edit ] In 2014, CHAdeMO published its protocol for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration, which also includes applications for vehicle to load (V2L) or vehicle to home-off grid (V2H), collectively denoted V2X. The technology enables EV owners to use the car as an energy storage device, potentially lowering costs by optimising energy usage for the current time of use pricing and providing electricity to the grid. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Since 2012, multiple V2X demo projects using the CHAdeMO protocol have been demonstrated worldwide. Some of the recent projects include UCSD INVENT [ 32 ] in the United States, as well as Sciurus and e4Future [ 33 ] in the United Kingdom that are supported by Innovate UK . CHAdeMO 3.0: ChaoJi [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from ChaoJi . [ edit ] The ChaoJi connector, also referenced as CHAdeMO 3.0, is a high-power charging standard for electric cars, released in 2020. [ 34 ] The connector has a lemniscate shape ( \u221e ), with a flat bottom edge and is planned for charging battery electric vehicles at up to 900 kilowatts using direct current .  The design incorporates backward compatibility with CHAdeMO (used globally) and the GB/T DC-charging (used mainly in mainland China), [ 35 ] using a dedicated inlet adapter for each system. The circuit interface of ChaoJi is also designed to be fully compatible with the Combined Charging System , also known as CCS (used mainly in Europe and North America). [ 36 ] A joint agreement between the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council (with State Grid Corporation of China ) was signed on 28 August 2018 [ 37 ] after which the development was enlarged to a larger international community of experts. [ 38 ] Charge2Bike [ edit ] A CHAdeMO standard for Electrically Power Assisted Cycle (EPAC) Electric bicycles charger (Charge2Bike v1.2) was released in late 2024 [ 39 ] . OEM like Bosch , Shimano , Yamaha and Panasonic are involved. The standard allows (fast) charging of the battery with direct current without the need to bring along the specific charger that connects to the AC grid. It provides up to 60 Volt DC, the Extra-low voltage deemed safe, and up to 20 A (max. 800 W). Similar standards already exist: the common USB-C is limited to 240 Watt (48 Volt, 5 Amp\u00e8re), while EnergyBus (48V, 30A, 1200W) already offers public chargers in parts of Europe, at higher power. Deployment [ edit ] CHAdeMO-type fast charging stations were initially installed in great numbers by TEPCO in Japan, which required the creation of an additional power distribution network to supply these stations. [ 40 ] Since then, CHAdeMO charger installation has expanded its geographical reach and in May 2023, the CHAdeMO Association stated that there were 57,800 CHAdeMO chargers installed in 99 countries.

[ 1 ] The name is an abbreviation of \"CHArge de MOve\" (which the organization translates as \"charge for moving\") and is derived from the Japanese phrase \" o CHA deMO ikaga desuka \" ( \u304a\u8336\u3067\u3082\u3044\u304b\u304c\u3067\u3059\u304b ), translating to English as \"How about a cup of tea?\", referring to the time it would take to charge a car. [ 1 ] It competes with the Combined Charging System (CCS), which since 2014 has been required on public charging infrastructure installed in the European Union , Tesla 's North American Charging System (NACS) used by its Supercharger network outside of Europe, and China's GB/T charging standard . As of 2022 [update] , CHAdeMO remains popular in Japan, but is being equipped on very few new cars sold in North America or Europe. First-generation CHAdeMO connectors deliver up to 62.5 kW by 500 V , 125 A direct current [ 2 ] through a proprietary electrical connector , adding about 120 kilometres (75\u00a0mi) of range in a half an hour. It has been included in several international vehicle charging standards. The second-generation specification allows for up to 400\u00a0kW by 1\u00a0kV, 400\u00a0A direct current. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The CHAdeMO Association is currently co-developing with China Electricity Council (CEC) the third-generation standard with the working name of \u201c ChaoJi \u201d that aims to deliver 900\u00a0kW. [ 5 ] The charging system is now considered outdated in the U.S, with the Nissan Leaf and the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV being the only models to use it in the country. History [ edit ] CHAdeMO connector (left), with the competing Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 2 connector (middle), and the AC Type 2 connector (right) CHAdeMO originated out of a charging system design from the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). TEPCO had been participating on numerous EV infrastructure trial projects between 2006 and 2009 in collaboration with Nissan , Mitsubishi , Fuji Heavy Industries (now Subaru ), and other manufacturers. [ 6 ] These trials resulted in TEPCO developing patented technology and a specification, [ 7 ] which would form the basis for the CHAdeMO. [ 8 ] The first commercial CHAdeMO charging infrastructure was commissioned in 2009 alongside the launch of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV . [ 9 ] In March 2010, TEPCO formed the CHAdeMO Association with Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Subaru. [ 10 ] They were later joined by Hitachi , Honda and Panasonic . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] CHAdeMO would be the first organization to propose a standardized DC fast charge system  to be shared across diverse EVs, regardless of their brands and models. CHAdeMO became a published international standard in 2014 when the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted IEC 61851 -23 for the charging system, IEC 61851 -24 for communication, and IEC 62196 -3 configuration AA for the connector. [ 13 ] Later that year, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (EN) added CHAdeMO as a published standard along with CCS Combo 2, followed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2016. [ 14 ] A major blow to the international adoption of CHAdeMO came in 2013 when European Commission designated the Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 2 as the mandated plug for DC high-power charging infrastructure in Europe. [ 15 ] While the European Parliament had contemplated transitioning out CHAdeMO infrastructure by January 2019, the final mandate only required that all publicly accessible chargers in the EU be equipped 'at least' with CCS Combo 2, allowing stations to offer multiple connector types. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] While CHAdeMO was the first fast-charging standard to see widespread deployment and remains widely equipped on vehicles sold in Japan, it has been losing market share in other countries. Honda was the first of the CHAdeMO Association members to stop equipping the connector on vehicles sold outside of Japan starting with the Clarity Electric in 2016. Nissan decided not to use CHAdeMO on its Ariya SUVs introduced in 2021 outside of Japan. Toyota and Subaru have also equipped their jointly developed bZ4X/Solterra with CCS connectors outside of Japan. As of June\u00a02022 [update] , the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV and Nissan Leaf are the only plug-in vehicles equipped with CHAdeMO for sale in North America. [ 18 ] As demand increased for EV charging services for Tesla vehicles after 2019, and prior to opening of the competing North American Charging System (NACS) in late 2022, several electric vehicle charging network operators had added some Tesla charging connector adapters to CHAdeMO-standard charging stations. These included, ONroute rest stop network in Ontario, Canada \u2014where a Tesla adaptor was permanently attached to a CHAdeMO connector on some 60 charge stations\u2014 [ 19 ] and REVEL opened a charging station in Brooklyn for a while after they were denied a license to operate a Tesla ride-hailing fleet in New York City. [ 20 ] Also, EVgo , added a few optional Tesla adaptors to CHAdeMO connectors as early as 2019. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Connector design [ edit ] CHAdeMO CHAdeMO electric vehicle connector Type Automotive power connector Production history Produced Since 2009 General specifications Diameter 70 millimetres (2.8\u00a0in) Pins 10 (1 reserved) Electrical Signal high-voltage DC Pinout Pinouts for CHAdeMO, looking at end of vehicle connector FG Ground reference for control lines SS1 / SS2 Charge sequence signal start/stop charging N/C (not connected) DCP Charging enable vehicle grants EVSE permission to connect power DC+ / DC- DC power supplied power PP Connector proximity detection charge interlock, disables drivetrain while connected C-H / C-L CAN bus communication with vehicle bus to establish operational parameters DC fast charge [ edit ] Most electric vehicles (EV) have an on-board charger that uses a full bridge rectifier to transform alternating current (AC) from the electrical grid to direct current (DC) suitable for recharging the EV's battery pack. [ 23 ] Most EVs are designed with limited AC input power, typically based on the available power of consumer outlets: for example, 240\u00a0V, 30\u00a0A in the United States and Japan; 240\u00a0V, 40\u00a0A in Canada; and 230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A or 3\u03c6 , 400\u00a0V, 32\u00a0A in Europe and Australia. AC chargers with higher limits have been specified, for example SAE J1772 -2009 has an option for 240\u00a0V, 80\u00a0A and VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 has a 3\u03c6, 400\u00a0V, 63\u00a0A. But these charger types have been rarely deployed. Cost and thermal issues limit how much power the rectifier can handle, so beyond approximately 240\u00a0V AC and 75\u00a0A it is better for an external charging station to deliver DC directly to the battery. For faster charging, dedicated DC chargers can be built in permanent locations and provided with high-current connections to the grid. Such high voltage and high-current charging is called a DC fast charge (DCFC) or DC quick charging (DCQC). [ 24 ] Connector protocols and history [ edit ] While the notion of shared off-board DC charging infrastructure, together with the charging system design for CHAdeMO came out of TEPCOs trials starting in 2006, the connector itself had been designed in 1993, and was specified by the 1993 Japan Electric Vehicle Standard (JEVS) G105-1993 from the JARI. [ 25 ] In addition to carrying power, the connector also makes a data connection using the CAN bus protocol. [ 26 ] This performs functions such as a safety interlock to avoid energizing the connector before it is safe (similar to SAE J1772 ), transmitting battery parameters to the charging station including when to stop charging (top battery percentage, usually 80%), target voltage, total battery capacity, and how the station should vary its output current while charging. [ 27 ] The first protocol issued was CHAdeMO 0.9, which offered maximum charging power of 62.5\u00a0kW (125\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC). Version 1.0 followed in 2012, enhancing vehicle protection, compatibility, and reliability. Version 1.1 (2015) allowed the current to dynamically change during charging; Version 1.2 (2017) increased maximum power to 200\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC). CHAdeMO published its protocol for 400\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 1\u00a0kV) 'ultra-fast' charging in May 2018 as CHAdeMO 2.0. [ 28 ] CHAdeMO 2.0 allowed the standard to better compete with the CCS 'ultra-fast' stations being built around the world as part of new networks such as IONITY charging consortium. [ 29 ] Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) [ edit ] In 2014, CHAdeMO published its protocol for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration, which also includes applications for vehicle to load (V2L) or vehicle to home-off grid (V2H), collectively denoted V2X. The technology enables EV owners to use the car as an energy storage device, potentially lowering costs by optimising energy usage for the current time of use pricing and providing electricity to the grid. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Since 2012, multiple V2X demo projects using the CHAdeMO protocol have been demonstrated worldwide. Some of the recent projects include UCSD INVENT [ 32 ] in the United States, as well as Sciurus and e4Future [ 33 ] in the United Kingdom that are supported by Innovate UK . CHAdeMO 3.0: ChaoJi [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from ChaoJi . [ edit ] The ChaoJi connector, also referenced as CHAdeMO 3.0, is a high-power charging standard for electric cars, released in 2020. [ 34 ] The connector has a lemniscate shape ( \u221e ), with a flat bottom edge and is planned for charging battery electric vehicles at up to 900 kilowatts using direct current .  The design incorporates backward compatibility with CHAdeMO (used globally) and the GB/T DC-charging (used mainly in mainland China), [ 35 ] using a dedicated inlet adapter for each system. The circuit interface of ChaoJi is also designed to be fully compatible with the Combined Charging System , also known as CCS (used mainly in Europe and North America). [ 36 ] A joint agreement between the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council (with State Grid Corporation of China ) was signed on 28 August 2018 [ 37 ] after which the development was enlarged to a larger international community of experts. [ 38 ] Charge2Bike [ edit ] A CHAdeMO standard for Electrically Power Assisted Cycle (EPAC) Electric bicycles charger (Charge2Bike v1.2) was released in late 2024 [ 39 ] . OEM like Bosch , Shimano , Yamaha and Panasonic are involved. The standard allows (fast) charging of the battery with direct current without the need to bring along the specific charger that connects to the AC grid. It provides up to 60 Volt DC, the Extra-low voltage deemed safe, and up to 20 A (max. 800 W). Similar standards already exist: the common USB-C is limited to 240 Watt (48 Volt, 5 Amp\u00e8re), while EnergyBus (48V, 30A, 1200W) already offers public chargers in parts of Europe, at higher power. Deployment [ edit ] CHAdeMO-type fast charging stations were initially installed in great numbers by TEPCO in Japan, which required the creation of an additional power distribution network to supply these stations. [ 40 ] Since then, CHAdeMO charger installation has expanded its geographical reach and in May 2023, the CHAdeMO Association stated that there were 57,800 CHAdeMO chargers installed in 99 countries. These included 9,600 charging stations in Japan, 31,600 in Europe, 9,400 in North America, and 7,000 elsewhere. [ 41 ] As of January 2022, a total of 260 certified CHAdeMO charger models have been produced by 50 companies.

[ 1 ] The name is an abbreviation of \"CHArge de MOve\" (which the organization translates as \"charge for moving\") and is derived from the Japanese phrase \" o CHA deMO ikaga desuka \" ( \u304a\u8336\u3067\u3082\u3044\u304b\u304c\u3067\u3059\u304b ), translating to English as \"How about a cup of tea?\", referring to the time it would take to charge a car. [ 1 ] It competes with the Combined Charging System (CCS), which since 2014 has been required on public charging infrastructure installed in the European Union , Tesla 's North American Charging System (NACS) used by its Supercharger network outside of Europe, and China's GB/T charging standard . As of 2022 [update] , CHAdeMO remains popular in Japan, but is being equipped on very few new cars sold in North America or Europe. First-generation CHAdeMO connectors deliver up to 62.5 kW by 500 V , 125 A direct current [ 2 ] through a proprietary electrical connector , adding about 120 kilometres (75\u00a0mi) of range in a half an hour. It has been included in several international vehicle charging standards. The second-generation specification allows for up to 400\u00a0kW by 1\u00a0kV, 400\u00a0A direct current. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The CHAdeMO Association is currently co-developing with China Electricity Council (CEC) the third-generation standard with the working name of \u201c ChaoJi \u201d that aims to deliver 900\u00a0kW. [ 5 ] The charging system is now considered outdated in the U.S, with the Nissan Leaf and the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV being the only models to use it in the country. History [ edit ] CHAdeMO connector (left), with the competing Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 2 connector (middle), and the AC Type 2 connector (right) CHAdeMO originated out of a charging system design from the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). TEPCO had been participating on numerous EV infrastructure trial projects between 2006 and 2009 in collaboration with Nissan , Mitsubishi , Fuji Heavy Industries (now Subaru ), and other manufacturers. [ 6 ] These trials resulted in TEPCO developing patented technology and a specification, [ 7 ] which would form the basis for the CHAdeMO. [ 8 ] The first commercial CHAdeMO charging infrastructure was commissioned in 2009 alongside the launch of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV . [ 9 ] In March 2010, TEPCO formed the CHAdeMO Association with Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Subaru. [ 10 ] They were later joined by Hitachi , Honda and Panasonic . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] CHAdeMO would be the first organization to propose a standardized DC fast charge system  to be shared across diverse EVs, regardless of their brands and models. CHAdeMO became a published international standard in 2014 when the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted IEC 61851 -23 for the charging system, IEC 61851 -24 for communication, and IEC 62196 -3 configuration AA for the connector. [ 13 ] Later that year, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (EN) added CHAdeMO as a published standard along with CCS Combo 2, followed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2016. [ 14 ] A major blow to the international adoption of CHAdeMO came in 2013 when European Commission designated the Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 2 as the mandated plug for DC high-power charging infrastructure in Europe. [ 15 ] While the European Parliament had contemplated transitioning out CHAdeMO infrastructure by January 2019, the final mandate only required that all publicly accessible chargers in the EU be equipped 'at least' with CCS Combo 2, allowing stations to offer multiple connector types. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] While CHAdeMO was the first fast-charging standard to see widespread deployment and remains widely equipped on vehicles sold in Japan, it has been losing market share in other countries. Honda was the first of the CHAdeMO Association members to stop equipping the connector on vehicles sold outside of Japan starting with the Clarity Electric in 2016. Nissan decided not to use CHAdeMO on its Ariya SUVs introduced in 2021 outside of Japan. Toyota and Subaru have also equipped their jointly developed bZ4X/Solterra with CCS connectors outside of Japan. As of June\u00a02022 [update] , the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV and Nissan Leaf are the only plug-in vehicles equipped with CHAdeMO for sale in North America. [ 18 ] As demand increased for EV charging services for Tesla vehicles after 2019, and prior to opening of the competing North American Charging System (NACS) in late 2022, several electric vehicle charging network operators had added some Tesla charging connector adapters to CHAdeMO-standard charging stations. These included, ONroute rest stop network in Ontario, Canada \u2014where a Tesla adaptor was permanently attached to a CHAdeMO connector on some 60 charge stations\u2014 [ 19 ] and REVEL opened a charging station in Brooklyn for a while after they were denied a license to operate a Tesla ride-hailing fleet in New York City. [ 20 ] Also, EVgo , added a few optional Tesla adaptors to CHAdeMO connectors as early as 2019. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Connector design [ edit ] CHAdeMO CHAdeMO electric vehicle connector Type Automotive power connector Production history Produced Since 2009 General specifications Diameter 70 millimetres (2.8\u00a0in) Pins 10 (1 reserved) Electrical Signal high-voltage DC Pinout Pinouts for CHAdeMO, looking at end of vehicle connector FG Ground reference for control lines SS1 / SS2 Charge sequence signal start/stop charging N/C (not connected) DCP Charging enable vehicle grants EVSE permission to connect power DC+ / DC- DC power supplied power PP Connector proximity detection charge interlock, disables drivetrain while connected C-H / C-L CAN bus communication with vehicle bus to establish operational parameters DC fast charge [ edit ] Most electric vehicles (EV) have an on-board charger that uses a full bridge rectifier to transform alternating current (AC) from the electrical grid to direct current (DC) suitable for recharging the EV's battery pack. [ 23 ] Most EVs are designed with limited AC input power, typically based on the available power of consumer outlets: for example, 240\u00a0V, 30\u00a0A in the United States and Japan; 240\u00a0V, 40\u00a0A in Canada; and 230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A or 3\u03c6 , 400\u00a0V, 32\u00a0A in Europe and Australia. AC chargers with higher limits have been specified, for example SAE J1772 -2009 has an option for 240\u00a0V, 80\u00a0A and VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 has a 3\u03c6, 400\u00a0V, 63\u00a0A. But these charger types have been rarely deployed. Cost and thermal issues limit how much power the rectifier can handle, so beyond approximately 240\u00a0V AC and 75\u00a0A it is better for an external charging station to deliver DC directly to the battery. For faster charging, dedicated DC chargers can be built in permanent locations and provided with high-current connections to the grid. Such high voltage and high-current charging is called a DC fast charge (DCFC) or DC quick charging (DCQC). [ 24 ] Connector protocols and history [ edit ] While the notion of shared off-board DC charging infrastructure, together with the charging system design for CHAdeMO came out of TEPCOs trials starting in 2006, the connector itself had been designed in 1993, and was specified by the 1993 Japan Electric Vehicle Standard (JEVS) G105-1993 from the JARI. [ 25 ] In addition to carrying power, the connector also makes a data connection using the CAN bus protocol. [ 26 ] This performs functions such as a safety interlock to avoid energizing the connector before it is safe (similar to SAE J1772 ), transmitting battery parameters to the charging station including when to stop charging (top battery percentage, usually 80%), target voltage, total battery capacity, and how the station should vary its output current while charging. [ 27 ] The first protocol issued was CHAdeMO 0.9, which offered maximum charging power of 62.5\u00a0kW (125\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC). Version 1.0 followed in 2012, enhancing vehicle protection, compatibility, and reliability. Version 1.1 (2015) allowed the current to dynamically change during charging; Version 1.2 (2017) increased maximum power to 200\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC). CHAdeMO published its protocol for 400\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 1\u00a0kV) 'ultra-fast' charging in May 2018 as CHAdeMO 2.0. [ 28 ] CHAdeMO 2.0 allowed the standard to better compete with the CCS 'ultra-fast' stations being built around the world as part of new networks such as IONITY charging consortium. [ 29 ] Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) [ edit ] In 2014, CHAdeMO published its protocol for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration, which also includes applications for vehicle to load (V2L) or vehicle to home-off grid (V2H), collectively denoted V2X. The technology enables EV owners to use the car as an energy storage device, potentially lowering costs by optimising energy usage for the current time of use pricing and providing electricity to the grid. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Since 2012, multiple V2X demo projects using the CHAdeMO protocol have been demonstrated worldwide. Some of the recent projects include UCSD INVENT [ 32 ] in the United States, as well as Sciurus and e4Future [ 33 ] in the United Kingdom that are supported by Innovate UK . CHAdeMO 3.0: ChaoJi [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from ChaoJi . [ edit ] The ChaoJi connector, also referenced as CHAdeMO 3.0, is a high-power charging standard for electric cars, released in 2020. [ 34 ] The connector has a lemniscate shape ( \u221e ), with a flat bottom edge and is planned for charging battery electric vehicles at up to 900 kilowatts using direct current .  The design incorporates backward compatibility with CHAdeMO (used globally) and the GB/T DC-charging (used mainly in mainland China), [ 35 ] using a dedicated inlet adapter for each system. The circuit interface of ChaoJi is also designed to be fully compatible with the Combined Charging System , also known as CCS (used mainly in Europe and North America). [ 36 ] A joint agreement between the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council (with State Grid Corporation of China ) was signed on 28 August 2018 [ 37 ] after which the development was enlarged to a larger international community of experts. [ 38 ] Charge2Bike [ edit ] A CHAdeMO standard for Electrically Power Assisted Cycle (EPAC) Electric bicycles charger (Charge2Bike v1.2) was released in late 2024 [ 39 ] . OEM like Bosch , Shimano , Yamaha and Panasonic are involved. The standard allows (fast) charging of the battery with direct current without the need to bring along the specific charger that connects to the AC grid. It provides up to 60 Volt DC, the Extra-low voltage deemed safe, and up to 20 A (max. 800 W). Similar standards already exist: the common USB-C is limited to 240 Watt (48 Volt, 5 Amp\u00e8re), while EnergyBus (48V, 30A, 1200W) already offers public chargers in parts of Europe, at higher power. Deployment [ edit ] CHAdeMO-type fast charging stations were initially installed in great numbers by TEPCO in Japan, which required the creation of an additional power distribution network to supply these stations. [ 40 ] Since then, CHAdeMO charger installation has expanded its geographical reach and in May 2023, the CHAdeMO Association stated that there were 57,800 CHAdeMO chargers installed in 99 countries. These included 9,600 charging stations in Japan, 31,600 in Europe, 9,400 in North America, and 7,000 elsewhere. [ 41 ] As of January 2022, a total of 260 certified CHAdeMO charger models have been produced by 50 companies.

CHAdeMO Association Charging station plug Formation 2010 ; 15\u00a0years ago ( 2010 ) Type Nonprofit Purpose Development of electric vehicle charging technology Website chademo .com CHAdeMO is a fast-charging system for battery electric vehicles , developed in 2010 by the CHAdeMO Association, formed by the Tokyo Electric Power Company and five major Japanese automakers. [ 1 ] The name is an abbreviation of \"CHArge de MOve\" (which the organization translates as \"charge for moving\") and is derived from the Japanese phrase \" o CHA deMO ikaga desuka \" ( \u304a\u8336\u3067\u3082\u3044\u304b\u304c\u3067\u3059\u304b ), translating to English as \"How about a cup of tea?\", referring to the time it would take to charge a car. [ 1 ] It competes with the Combined Charging System (CCS), which since 2014 has been required on public charging infrastructure installed in the European Union , Tesla 's North American Charging System (NACS) used by its Supercharger network outside of Europe, and China's GB/T charging standard . As of 2022 [update] , CHAdeMO remains popular in Japan, but is being equipped on very few new cars sold in North America or Europe. First-generation CHAdeMO connectors deliver up to 62.5 kW by 500 V , 125 A direct current [ 2 ] through a proprietary electrical connector , adding about 120 kilometres (75\u00a0mi) of range in a half an hour. It has been included in several international vehicle charging standards. The second-generation specification allows for up to 400\u00a0kW by 1\u00a0kV, 400\u00a0A direct current. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The CHAdeMO Association is currently co-developing with China Electricity Council (CEC) the third-generation standard with the working name of \u201c ChaoJi \u201d that aims to deliver 900\u00a0kW. [ 5 ] The charging system is now considered outdated in the U.S, with the Nissan Leaf and the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV being the only models to use it in the country. History [ edit ] CHAdeMO connector (left), with the competing Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 2 connector (middle), and the AC Type 2 connector (right) CHAdeMO originated out of a charging system design from the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). TEPCO had been participating on numerous EV infrastructure trial projects between 2006 and 2009 in collaboration with Nissan , Mitsubishi , Fuji Heavy Industries (now Subaru ), and other manufacturers. [ 6 ] These trials resulted in TEPCO developing patented technology and a specification, [ 7 ] which would form the basis for the CHAdeMO. [ 8 ] The first commercial CHAdeMO charging infrastructure was commissioned in 2009 alongside the launch of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV . [ 9 ] In March 2010, TEPCO formed the CHAdeMO Association with Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Subaru. [ 10 ] They were later joined by Hitachi , Honda and Panasonic . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] CHAdeMO would be the first organization to propose a standardized DC fast charge system  to be shared across diverse EVs, regardless of their brands and models. CHAdeMO became a published international standard in 2014 when the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted IEC 61851 -23 for the charging system, IEC 61851 -24 for communication, and IEC 62196 -3 configuration AA for the connector. [ 13 ] Later that year, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (EN) added CHAdeMO as a published standard along with CCS Combo 2, followed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2016. [ 14 ] A major blow to the international adoption of CHAdeMO came in 2013 when European Commission designated the Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 2 as the mandated plug for DC high-power charging infrastructure in Europe. [ 15 ] While the European Parliament had contemplated transitioning out CHAdeMO infrastructure by January 2019, the final mandate only required that all publicly accessible chargers in the EU be equipped 'at least' with CCS Combo 2, allowing stations to offer multiple connector types. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] While CHAdeMO was the first fast-charging standard to see widespread deployment and remains widely equipped on vehicles sold in Japan, it has been losing market share in other countries. Honda was the first of the CHAdeMO Association members to stop equipping the connector on vehicles sold outside of Japan starting with the Clarity Electric in 2016. Nissan decided not to use CHAdeMO on its Ariya SUVs introduced in 2021 outside of Japan. Toyota and Subaru have also equipped their jointly developed bZ4X/Solterra with CCS connectors outside of Japan. As of June\u00a02022 [update] , the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV and Nissan Leaf are the only plug-in vehicles equipped with CHAdeMO for sale in North America. [ 18 ] As demand increased for EV charging services for Tesla vehicles after 2019, and prior to opening of the competing North American Charging System (NACS) in late 2022, several electric vehicle charging network operators had added some Tesla charging connector adapters to CHAdeMO-standard charging stations. These included, ONroute rest stop network in Ontario, Canada \u2014where a Tesla adaptor was permanently attached to a CHAdeMO connector on some 60 charge stations\u2014 [ 19 ] and REVEL opened a charging station in Brooklyn for a while after they were denied a license to operate a Tesla ride-hailing fleet in New York City. [ 20 ] Also, EVgo , added a few optional Tesla adaptors to CHAdeMO connectors as early as 2019. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Connector design [ edit ] CHAdeMO CHAdeMO electric vehicle connector Type Automotive power connector Production history Produced Since 2009 General specifications Diameter 70 millimetres (2.8\u00a0in) Pins 10 (1 reserved) Electrical Signal high-voltage DC Pinout Pinouts for CHAdeMO, looking at end of vehicle connector FG Ground reference for control lines SS1 / SS2 Charge sequence signal start/stop charging N/C (not connected) DCP Charging enable vehicle grants EVSE permission to connect power DC+ / DC- DC power supplied power PP Connector proximity detection charge interlock, disables drivetrain while connected C-H / C-L CAN bus communication with vehicle bus to establish operational parameters DC fast charge [ edit ] Most electric vehicles (EV) have an on-board charger that uses a full bridge rectifier to transform alternating current (AC) from the electrical grid to direct current (DC) suitable for recharging the EV's battery pack. [ 23 ] Most EVs are designed with limited AC input power, typically based on the available power of consumer outlets: for example, 240\u00a0V, 30\u00a0A in the United States and Japan; 240\u00a0V, 40\u00a0A in Canada; and 230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A or 3\u03c6 , 400\u00a0V, 32\u00a0A in Europe and Australia. AC chargers with higher limits have been specified, for example SAE J1772 -2009 has an option for 240\u00a0V, 80\u00a0A and VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 has a 3\u03c6, 400\u00a0V, 63\u00a0A. But these charger types have been rarely deployed. Cost and thermal issues limit how much power the rectifier can handle, so beyond approximately 240\u00a0V AC and 75\u00a0A it is better for an external charging station to deliver DC directly to the battery. For faster charging, dedicated DC chargers can be built in permanent locations and provided with high-current connections to the grid. Such high voltage and high-current charging is called a DC fast charge (DCFC) or DC quick charging (DCQC). [ 24 ] Connector protocols and history [ edit ] While the notion of shared off-board DC charging infrastructure, together with the charging system design for CHAdeMO came out of TEPCOs trials starting in 2006, the connector itself had been designed in 1993, and was specified by the 1993 Japan Electric Vehicle Standard (JEVS) G105-1993 from the JARI. [ 25 ] In addition to carrying power, the connector also makes a data connection using the CAN bus protocol. [ 26 ] This performs functions such as a safety interlock to avoid energizing the connector before it is safe (similar to SAE J1772 ), transmitting battery parameters to the charging station including when to stop charging (top battery percentage, usually 80%), target voltage, total battery capacity, and how the station should vary its output current while charging. [ 27 ] The first protocol issued was CHAdeMO 0.9, which offered maximum charging power of 62.5\u00a0kW (125\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC). Version 1.0 followed in 2012, enhancing vehicle protection, compatibility, and reliability. Version 1.1 (2015) allowed the current to dynamically change during charging; Version 1.2 (2017) increased maximum power to 200\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC). CHAdeMO published its protocol for 400\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 1\u00a0kV) 'ultra-fast' charging in May 2018 as CHAdeMO 2.0. [ 28 ] CHAdeMO 2.0 allowed the standard to better compete with the CCS 'ultra-fast' stations being built around the world as part of new networks such as IONITY charging consortium. [ 29 ] Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) [ edit ] In 2014, CHAdeMO published its protocol for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration, which also includes applications for vehicle to load (V2L) or vehicle to home-off grid (V2H), collectively denoted V2X. The technology enables EV owners to use the car as an energy storage device, potentially lowering costs by optimising energy usage for the current time of use pricing and providing electricity to the grid. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Since 2012, multiple V2X demo projects using the CHAdeMO protocol have been demonstrated worldwide. Some of the recent projects include UCSD INVENT [ 32 ] in the United States, as well as Sciurus and e4Future [ 33 ] in the United Kingdom that are supported by Innovate UK . CHAdeMO 3.0: ChaoJi [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from ChaoJi . [ edit ] The ChaoJi connector, also referenced as CHAdeMO 3.0, is a high-power charging standard for electric cars, released in 2020. [ 34 ] The connector has a lemniscate shape ( \u221e ), with a flat bottom edge and is planned for charging battery electric vehicles at up to 900 kilowatts using direct current .  The design incorporates backward compatibility with CHAdeMO (used globally) and the GB/T DC-charging (used mainly in mainland China), [ 35 ] using a dedicated inlet adapter for each system. The circuit interface of ChaoJi is also designed to be fully compatible with the Combined Charging System , also known as CCS (used mainly in Europe and North America). [ 36 ] A joint agreement between the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council (with State Grid Corporation of China ) was signed on 28 August 2018 [ 37 ] after which the development was enlarged to a larger international community of experts. [ 38 ] Charge2Bike [ edit ] A CHAdeMO standard for Electrically Power Assisted Cycle (EPAC) Electric bicycles charger (Charge2Bike v1.2) was released in late 2024 [ 39 ] . OEM like Bosch , Shimano , Yamaha and Panasonic are involved. The standard allows (fast) charging of the battery with direct current without the need to bring along the specific charger that connects to the AC grid. It provides up to 60 Volt DC, the Extra-low voltage deemed safe, and up to 20 A (max. 800 W). Similar standards already exist: the common USB-C is limited to 240 Watt (48 Volt, 5 Amp\u00e8re), while EnergyBus (48V, 30A, 1200W) already offers public chargers in parts of Europe, at higher power. Deployment [ edit ] CHAdeMO-type fast charging stations were initially installed in great numbers by TEPCO in Japan, which required the creation of an additional power distribution network to supply these stations. [ 40 ] Since then, CHAdeMO charger installation has expanded its geographical reach and in May 2023, the CHAdeMO Association stated that there were 57,800 CHAdeMO chargers installed in 99 countries. These included 9,600 charging stations in Japan, 31,600 in Europe, 9,400 in North America, and 7,000 elsewhere. [ 41 ] As of January 2022, a total of 260 certified CHAdeMO charger models have been produced by 50 companies.

[ 1 ] The name is an abbreviation of \"CHArge de MOve\" (which the organization translates as \"charge for moving\") and is derived from the Japanese phrase \" o CHA deMO ikaga desuka \" ( \u304a\u8336\u3067\u3082\u3044\u304b\u304c\u3067\u3059\u304b ), translating to English as \"How about a cup of tea?\", referring to the time it would take to charge a car. [ 1 ] It competes with the Combined Charging System (CCS), which since 2014 has been required on public charging infrastructure installed in the European Union , Tesla 's North American Charging System (NACS) used by its Supercharger network outside of Europe, and China's GB/T charging standard . As of 2022 [update] , CHAdeMO remains popular in Japan, but is being equipped on very few new cars sold in North America or Europe. First-generation CHAdeMO connectors deliver up to 62.5 kW by 500 V , 125 A direct current [ 2 ] through a proprietary electrical connector , adding about 120 kilometres (75\u00a0mi) of range in a half an hour. It has been included in several international vehicle charging standards. The second-generation specification allows for up to 400\u00a0kW by 1\u00a0kV, 400\u00a0A direct current. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The CHAdeMO Association is currently co-developing with China Electricity Council (CEC) the third-generation standard with the working name of \u201c ChaoJi \u201d that aims to deliver 900\u00a0kW. [ 5 ] The charging system is now considered outdated in the U.S, with the Nissan Leaf and the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV being the only models to use it in the country. History [ edit ] CHAdeMO connector (left), with the competing Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 2 connector (middle), and the AC Type 2 connector (right) CHAdeMO originated out of a charging system design from the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). TEPCO had been participating on numerous EV infrastructure trial projects between 2006 and 2009 in collaboration with Nissan , Mitsubishi , Fuji Heavy Industries (now Subaru ), and other manufacturers. [ 6 ] These trials resulted in TEPCO developing patented technology and a specification, [ 7 ] which would form the basis for the CHAdeMO. [ 8 ] The first commercial CHAdeMO charging infrastructure was commissioned in 2009 alongside the launch of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV . [ 9 ] In March 2010, TEPCO formed the CHAdeMO Association with Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Subaru. [ 10 ] They were later joined by Hitachi , Honda and Panasonic . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] CHAdeMO would be the first organization to propose a standardized DC fast charge system  to be shared across diverse EVs, regardless of their brands and models. CHAdeMO became a published international standard in 2014 when the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted IEC 61851 -23 for the charging system, IEC 61851 -24 for communication, and IEC 62196 -3 configuration AA for the connector. [ 13 ] Later that year, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (EN) added CHAdeMO as a published standard along with CCS Combo 2, followed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2016. [ 14 ] A major blow to the international adoption of CHAdeMO came in 2013 when European Commission designated the Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 2 as the mandated plug for DC high-power charging infrastructure in Europe. [ 15 ] While the European Parliament had contemplated transitioning out CHAdeMO infrastructure by January 2019, the final mandate only required that all publicly accessible chargers in the EU be equipped 'at least' with CCS Combo 2, allowing stations to offer multiple connector types. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] While CHAdeMO was the first fast-charging standard to see widespread deployment and remains widely equipped on vehicles sold in Japan, it has been losing market share in other countries. Honda was the first of the CHAdeMO Association members to stop equipping the connector on vehicles sold outside of Japan starting with the Clarity Electric in 2016. Nissan decided not to use CHAdeMO on its Ariya SUVs introduced in 2021 outside of Japan. Toyota and Subaru have also equipped their jointly developed bZ4X/Solterra with CCS connectors outside of Japan. As of June\u00a02022 [update] , the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV and Nissan Leaf are the only plug-in vehicles equipped with CHAdeMO for sale in North America. [ 18 ] As demand increased for EV charging services for Tesla vehicles after 2019, and prior to opening of the competing North American Charging System (NACS) in late 2022, several electric vehicle charging network operators had added some Tesla charging connector adapters to CHAdeMO-standard charging stations. These included, ONroute rest stop network in Ontario, Canada \u2014where a Tesla adaptor was permanently attached to a CHAdeMO connector on some 60 charge stations\u2014 [ 19 ] and REVEL opened a charging station in Brooklyn for a while after they were denied a license to operate a Tesla ride-hailing fleet in New York City. [ 20 ] Also, EVgo , added a few optional Tesla adaptors to CHAdeMO connectors as early as 2019. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Connector design [ edit ] CHAdeMO CHAdeMO electric vehicle connector Type Automotive power connector Production history Produced Since 2009 General specifications Diameter 70 millimetres (2.8\u00a0in) Pins 10 (1 reserved) Electrical Signal high-voltage DC Pinout Pinouts for CHAdeMO, looking at end of vehicle connector FG Ground reference for control lines SS1 / SS2 Charge sequence signal start/stop charging N/C (not connected) DCP Charging enable vehicle grants EVSE permission to connect power DC+ / DC- DC power supplied power PP Connector proximity detection charge interlock, disables drivetrain while connected C-H / C-L CAN bus communication with vehicle bus to establish operational parameters DC fast charge [ edit ] Most electric vehicles (EV) have an on-board charger that uses a full bridge rectifier to transform alternating current (AC) from the electrical grid to direct current (DC) suitable for recharging the EV's battery pack. [ 23 ] Most EVs are designed with limited AC input power, typically based on the available power of consumer outlets: for example, 240\u00a0V, 30\u00a0A in the United States and Japan; 240\u00a0V, 40\u00a0A in Canada; and 230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A or 3\u03c6 , 400\u00a0V, 32\u00a0A in Europe and Australia. AC chargers with higher limits have been specified, for example SAE J1772 -2009 has an option for 240\u00a0V, 80\u00a0A and VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 has a 3\u03c6, 400\u00a0V, 63\u00a0A. But these charger types have been rarely deployed. Cost and thermal issues limit how much power the rectifier can handle, so beyond approximately 240\u00a0V AC and 75\u00a0A it is better for an external charging station to deliver DC directly to the battery. For faster charging, dedicated DC chargers can be built in permanent locations and provided with high-current connections to the grid. Such high voltage and high-current charging is called a DC fast charge (DCFC) or DC quick charging (DCQC). [ 24 ] Connector protocols and history [ edit ] While the notion of shared off-board DC charging infrastructure, together with the charging system design for CHAdeMO came out of TEPCOs trials starting in 2006, the connector itself had been designed in 1993, and was specified by the 1993 Japan Electric Vehicle Standard (JEVS) G105-1993 from the JARI. [ 25 ] In addition to carrying power, the connector also makes a data connection using the CAN bus protocol. [ 26 ] This performs functions such as a safety interlock to avoid energizing the connector before it is safe (similar to SAE J1772 ), transmitting battery parameters to the charging station including when to stop charging (top battery percentage, usually 80%), target voltage, total battery capacity, and how the station should vary its output current while charging. [ 27 ] The first protocol issued was CHAdeMO 0.9, which offered maximum charging power of 62.5\u00a0kW (125\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC). Version 1.0 followed in 2012, enhancing vehicle protection, compatibility, and reliability. Version 1.1 (2015) allowed the current to dynamically change during charging; Version 1.2 (2017) increased maximum power to 200\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC). CHAdeMO published its protocol for 400\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 1\u00a0kV) 'ultra-fast' charging in May 2018 as CHAdeMO 2.0. [ 28 ] CHAdeMO 2.0 allowed the standard to better compete with the CCS 'ultra-fast' stations being built around the world as part of new networks such as IONITY charging consortium. [ 29 ] Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) [ edit ] In 2014, CHAdeMO published its protocol for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration, which also includes applications for vehicle to load (V2L) or vehicle to home-off grid (V2H), collectively denoted V2X. The technology enables EV owners to use the car as an energy storage device, potentially lowering costs by optimising energy usage for the current time of use pricing and providing electricity to the grid. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Since 2012, multiple V2X demo projects using the CHAdeMO protocol have been demonstrated worldwide. Some of the recent projects include UCSD INVENT [ 32 ] in the United States, as well as Sciurus and e4Future [ 33 ] in the United Kingdom that are supported by Innovate UK . CHAdeMO 3.0: ChaoJi [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from ChaoJi . [ edit ] The ChaoJi connector, also referenced as CHAdeMO 3.0, is a high-power charging standard for electric cars, released in 2020. [ 34 ] The connector has a lemniscate shape ( \u221e ), with a flat bottom edge and is planned for charging battery electric vehicles at up to 900 kilowatts using direct current .  The design incorporates backward compatibility with CHAdeMO (used globally) and the GB/T DC-charging (used mainly in mainland China), [ 35 ] using a dedicated inlet adapter for each system. The circuit interface of ChaoJi is also designed to be fully compatible with the Combined Charging System , also known as CCS (used mainly in Europe and North America). [ 36 ] A joint agreement between the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council (with State Grid Corporation of China ) was signed on 28 August 2018 [ 37 ] after which the development was enlarged to a larger international community of experts. [ 38 ] Charge2Bike [ edit ] A CHAdeMO standard for Electrically Power Assisted Cycle (EPAC) Electric bicycles charger (Charge2Bike v1.2) was released in late 2024 [ 39 ] . OEM like Bosch , Shimano , Yamaha and Panasonic are involved. The standard allows (fast) charging of the battery with direct current without the need to bring along the specific charger that connects to the AC grid. It provides up to 60 Volt DC, the Extra-low voltage deemed safe, and up to 20 A (max. 800 W). Similar standards already exist: the common USB-C is limited to 240 Watt (48 Volt, 5 Amp\u00e8re), while EnergyBus (48V, 30A, 1200W) already offers public chargers in parts of Europe, at higher power. Deployment [ edit ] CHAdeMO-type fast charging stations were initially installed in great numbers by TEPCO in Japan, which required the creation of an additional power distribution network to supply these stations. [ 40 ] Since then, CHAdeMO charger installation has expanded its geographical reach and in May 2023, the CHAdeMO Association stated that there were 57,800 CHAdeMO chargers installed in 99 countries. These included 9,600 charging stations in Japan, 31,600 in Europe, 9,400 in North America, and 7,000 elsewhere. [ 41 ] As of January 2022, a total of 260 certified CHAdeMO charger models have been produced by 50 companies.

[ 23 ] Most EVs are designed with limited AC input power, typically based on the available power of consumer outlets: for example, 240\u00a0V, 30\u00a0A in the United States and Japan; 240\u00a0V, 40\u00a0A in Canada; and 230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A or 3\u03c6 , 400\u00a0V, 32\u00a0A in Europe and Australia. AC chargers with higher limits have been specified, for example SAE J1772 -2009 has an option for 240\u00a0V, 80\u00a0A and VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 has a 3\u03c6, 400\u00a0V, 63\u00a0A. But these charger types have been rarely deployed. Cost and thermal issues limit how much power the rectifier can handle, so beyond approximately 240\u00a0V AC and 75\u00a0A it is better for an external charging station to deliver DC directly to the battery. For faster charging, dedicated DC chargers can be built in permanent locations and provided with high-current connections to the grid. Such high voltage and high-current charging is called a DC fast charge (DCFC) or DC quick charging (DCQC). [ 24 ] Connector protocols and history [ edit ] While the notion of shared off-board DC charging infrastructure, together with the charging system design for CHAdeMO came out of TEPCOs trials starting in 2006, the connector itself had been designed in 1993, and was specified by the 1993 Japan Electric Vehicle Standard (JEVS) G105-1993 from the JARI. [ 25 ] In addition to carrying power, the connector also makes a data connection using the CAN bus protocol. [ 26 ] This performs functions such as a safety interlock to avoid energizing the connector before it is safe (similar to SAE J1772 ), transmitting battery parameters to the charging station including when to stop charging (top battery percentage, usually 80%), target voltage, total battery capacity, and how the station should vary its output current while charging. [ 27 ] The first protocol issued was CHAdeMO 0.9, which offered maximum charging power of 62.5\u00a0kW (125\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC). Version 1.0 followed in 2012, enhancing vehicle protection, compatibility, and reliability. Version 1.1 (2015) allowed the current to dynamically change during charging; Version 1.2 (2017) increased maximum power to 200\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC). CHAdeMO published its protocol for 400\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 1\u00a0kV) 'ultra-fast' charging in May 2018 as CHAdeMO 2.0. [ 28 ] CHAdeMO 2.0 allowed the standard to better compete with the CCS 'ultra-fast' stations being built around the world as part of new networks such as IONITY charging consortium. [ 29 ] Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) [ edit ] In 2014, CHAdeMO published its protocol for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration, which also includes applications for vehicle to load (V2L) or vehicle to home-off grid (V2H), collectively denoted V2X. The technology enables EV owners to use the car as an energy storage device, potentially lowering costs by optimising energy usage for the current time of use pricing and providing electricity to the grid. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Since 2012, multiple V2X demo projects using the CHAdeMO protocol have been demonstrated worldwide. Some of the recent projects include UCSD INVENT [ 32 ] in the United States, as well as Sciurus and e4Future [ 33 ] in the United Kingdom that are supported by Innovate UK . CHAdeMO 3.0: ChaoJi [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from ChaoJi . [ edit ] The ChaoJi connector, also referenced as CHAdeMO 3.0, is a high-power charging standard for electric cars, released in 2020. [ 34 ] The connector has a lemniscate shape ( \u221e ), with a flat bottom edge and is planned for charging battery electric vehicles at up to 900 kilowatts using direct current .  The design incorporates backward compatibility with CHAdeMO (used globally) and the GB/T DC-charging (used mainly in mainland China), [ 35 ] using a dedicated inlet adapter for each system. The circuit interface of ChaoJi is also designed to be fully compatible with the Combined Charging System , also known as CCS (used mainly in Europe and North America). [ 36 ] A joint agreement between the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council (with State Grid Corporation of China ) was signed on 28 August 2018 [ 37 ] after which the development was enlarged to a larger international community of experts. [ 38 ] Charge2Bike [ edit ] A CHAdeMO standard for Electrically Power Assisted Cycle (EPAC) Electric bicycles charger (Charge2Bike v1.2) was released in late 2024 [ 39 ] . OEM like Bosch , Shimano , Yamaha and Panasonic are involved. The standard allows (fast) charging of the battery with direct current without the need to bring along the specific charger that connects to the AC grid. It provides up to 60 Volt DC, the Extra-low voltage deemed safe, and up to 20 A (max. 800 W). Similar standards already exist: the common USB-C is limited to 240 Watt (48 Volt, 5 Amp\u00e8re), while EnergyBus (48V, 30A, 1200W) already offers public chargers in parts of Europe, at higher power. Deployment [ edit ] CHAdeMO-type fast charging stations were initially installed in great numbers by TEPCO in Japan, which required the creation of an additional power distribution network to supply these stations. [ 40 ] Since then, CHAdeMO charger installation has expanded its geographical reach and in May 2023, the CHAdeMO Association stated that there were 57,800 CHAdeMO chargers installed in 99 countries. These included 9,600 charging stations in Japan, 31,600 in Europe, 9,400 in North America, and 7,000 elsewhere. [ 41 ] As of January 2022, a total of 260 certified CHAdeMO charger models have been produced by 50 companies.

[ 1 ] The name is an abbreviation of \"CHArge de MOve\" (which the organization translates as \"charge for moving\") and is derived from the Japanese phrase \" o CHA deMO ikaga desuka \" ( \u304a\u8336\u3067\u3082\u3044\u304b\u304c\u3067\u3059\u304b ), translating to English as \"How about a cup of tea?\", referring to the time it would take to charge a car. [ 1 ]\nIt competes with the Combined Charging System (CCS), which since 2014 has been required on public charging infrastructure installed in the European Union , Tesla 's North American Charging System (NACS) used by its Supercharger network outside of Europe, and China's GB/T charging standard .\nAs of 2022 [update] , CHAdeMO remains popular in Japan, but is being equipped on very few new cars sold in North America or Europe.\nFirst-generation CHAdeMO connectors deliver up to 62.5 kW by 500 V , 125 A direct current [ 2 ] through a proprietary electrical connector , adding about 120 kilometres (75\u00a0mi) of range in a half an hour. It has been included in several international vehicle charging standards.\nThe second-generation specification allows for up to 400\u00a0kW by 1\u00a0kV, 400\u00a0A direct current. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The CHAdeMO Association is currently co-developing with China Electricity Council (CEC) the third-generation standard with the working name of \u201c ChaoJi \u201d that aims to deliver 900\u00a0kW. [ 5 ]\nThe charging system is now considered outdated in the U.S, with the Nissan Leaf and the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV being the only models to use it in the country.\nHistory [ edit ]\nHistory\nCHAdeMO originated out of a charging system design from the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). TEPCO had been participating on numerous EV infrastructure trial projects between 2006 and 2009 in collaboration with Nissan , Mitsubishi , Fuji Heavy Industries (now Subaru ), and other manufacturers. [ 6 ] These trials resulted in TEPCO developing patented technology and a specification, [ 7 ] which would form the basis for the CHAdeMO. [ 8 ]\nThe first commercial CHAdeMO charging infrastructure was commissioned in 2009 alongside the launch of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV . [ 9 ]\nIn March 2010, TEPCO formed the CHAdeMO Association with Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Subaru. [ 10 ] They were later joined by Hitachi , Honda and Panasonic . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] CHAdeMO would be the first organization to propose a standardized DC fast charge system  to be shared across diverse EVs, regardless of their brands and models.\nCHAdeMO became a published international standard in 2014 when the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted IEC 61851 -23 for the charging system, IEC 61851 -24 for communication, and IEC 62196 -3 configuration AA for the connector. [ 13 ] Later that year, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (EN) added CHAdeMO as a published standard along with CCS Combo 2, followed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2016. [ 14 ]\nA major blow to the international adoption of CHAdeMO came in 2013 when European Commission designated the Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 2 as the mandated plug for DC high-power charging infrastructure in Europe. [ 15 ] While the European Parliament had contemplated transitioning out CHAdeMO infrastructure by January 2019, the final mandate only required that all publicly accessible chargers in the EU be equipped 'at least' with CCS Combo 2, allowing stations to offer multiple connector types. [ 16 ] [ 17 ]\nWhile CHAdeMO was the first fast-charging standard to see widespread deployment and remains widely equipped on vehicles sold in Japan, it has been losing market share in other countries. Honda was the first of the CHAdeMO Association members to stop equipping the connector on vehicles sold outside of Japan starting with the Clarity Electric in 2016. Nissan decided not to use CHAdeMO on its Ariya SUVs introduced in 2021 outside of Japan. Toyota and Subaru have also equipped their jointly developed bZ4X/Solterra with CCS connectors outside of Japan. As of June\u00a02022 [update] , the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV and Nissan Leaf are the only plug-in vehicles equipped with CHAdeMO for sale in North America. [ 18 ]\nAs demand increased for EV charging services for Tesla vehicles after 2019, and prior to opening of the competing North American Charging System (NACS) in late 2022, several electric vehicle charging network operators had added some Tesla charging connector adapters to CHAdeMO-standard charging stations. These included, ONroute rest stop network in Ontario, Canada \u2014where a Tesla adaptor was permanently attached to a CHAdeMO connector on some 60 charge stations\u2014 [ 19 ] and REVEL opened a charging station in Brooklyn for a while after they were denied a license to operate a Tesla ride-hailing fleet in New York City. [ 20 ] Also, EVgo , added a few optional Tesla adaptors to CHAdeMO connectors as early as 2019.

OEM like Bosch , Shimano , Yamaha and Panasonic are involved.\nThe standard allows (fast) charging of the battery with direct current without the need to bring along the specific charger that connects to the AC grid. It provides up to 60 Volt DC, the Extra-low voltage deemed safe, and up to 20 A (max. 800 W).\nSimilar standards already exist: the common USB-C is limited to 240 Watt (48 Volt, 5 Amp\u00e8re), while EnergyBus (48V, 30A, 1200W) already offers public chargers in parts of Europe, at higher power.\nDeployment [ edit ]\nDeployment\nCHAdeMO-type fast charging stations were initially installed in great numbers by TEPCO in Japan, which required the creation of an additional power distribution network to supply these stations. [ 40 ]\nSince then, CHAdeMO charger installation has expanded its geographical reach and in May 2023, the CHAdeMO Association stated that there were 57,800 CHAdeMO chargers installed in 99 countries. These included 9,600 charging stations in Japan, 31,600 in Europe, 9,400 in North America, and 7,000 elsewhere. [ 41 ]\nAs of January 2022, a total of 260 certified CHAdeMO charger models have been produced by 50 companies.

It is an extension of the J1772 standard AC charging connector. CCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins Connectors: Incomplete Combo 2 (left) showing the two large direct current (DC) pins below, while the four alternating current (AC) pins for neutral and three-phase are removed, while the signal pins of Type 2 remain, compared to IEC Type 2 (right). Typical Combined Charging System (Combo 2) vehicle inlet CCS Combo 2 at European Tesla Model 3 vehicle inlet The Combined Charging System ( CCS ) is a charging station standard for plug-in electric vehicles that uses the Combo 1 ( CCS1 ) or Combo 2 ( CCS2 ) connectors, which are extensions of the IEC 62196 Type 1 and Type 2 alternating current (AC) connectors, respectively, each with two additional direct current (DC) contacts to allow high-power fast charging. CCS chargers can provide power to electric vehicle batteries at up to 500 kW (max.\u00a01000 V and 500 A ), [ 1 ] and in response to demands for even faster charging, 400 kW CCS chargers have been deployed by charging networks and 990 kW CCS chargers have been demonstrated. Electric vehicles and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) are considered CCS-capable if they support either AC or DC charging according to the CCS standards. Manufacturers that support CCS include BMW , Daimler , FCA , Jaguar , Groupe PSA , Honda , Hyundai , Kia , Mazda , MG , Nissan , Polestar , Renault , Rivian , Tesla , Mahindra , Tata Motors and Volkswagen Group , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] as well as Ford and General Motors for their 2024 North American EV models. [ 4 ] Chinese automakers such as BYD , Chery and Zeekr also export CCS2 vehicles for their overseas markets. The CCS standard allows AC charging using the Type 1 and Type 2 connector depending on the geographical region and the charging infrastructure available. This charging environment encompasses charging couplers, charging communication, charging stations, the electric vehicle and various functions for the charging process such as load balancing and charge authorization. Competing charging systems for high-power DC charging include CHAdeMO (widely used in Japan, previously used in North America and Europe), [ 5 ] GB/T (China), [ 6 ] and the North American Charging System developed by Tesla. [ 7 ] History [ edit ] The revival of interest in electric cars in the 1990s spurred deployment of charging stations .  Initially, these accessed the abundant AC mains electricity using a variety of plugs around the world. From 2003, the standardization in IEC 62196 of higher-current charging connectors brought about various systems: Type 1 was used primarily in North America and Japan, and Type 2 variants elsewhere. For DC charging, the SAE and European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) made a plan in 2011 to add common DC wires to the existing AC connector types such that there would be only one \"global envelope\" that fitted all DC charging stations. [ 8 ] Combo connector for DC charging (using only the signal pins of Type 2) and the Combo inlet on the vehicle (allowing also AC charging) Electric car charging with CCS The proposal for a \"Combined Charging System\" (CCS) was published at the 15th International VDI -Congress (Association of German Engineers) on 12 October 2011 in Baden-Baden . CCS defines a single connector pattern on the vehicle side that offers enough space for a Type 1 or Type 2 connector, along with space for a two-pin DC connector allowing charging at up to 200 amps. Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Porsche and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce CCS in mid-2012. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In May 2012, ACEA endorsed the standardization of the Combo 2 connector across the European Union . [ 11 ] ACEA were joined later that month by the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) and The Union of the Electricity Industry (EURELECTRIC). [ 12 ] Also that month, prototype implementations for up to 100\u00a0kW were shown at EVS26 in Los Angeles . [ 13 ] DC charging specifications in IEC\u00a062196-3 (2014) give a range up to 125\u00a0A at up to 850\u00a0V. [ 14 ] The seven auto makers also agreed in 2011 to use HomePlug GreenPHY as the communication protocol. [ 15 ] The prototype for the matching plug was developed by Phoenix Contact with the goal to withstand 10,000 connect cycles. [ 16 ] The standardization proposal was sent to the IEC in January 2011. [ 17 ] The request to use a PLC [ clarification needed ] protocol for Vehicle2Grid communication was made in September 2009 in a joint presentation of BMW, Daimler and VW at a California Air Resources Board ZEV Technology Symposium. [ 18 ] This competed with the CAN bus proposal from Japan (including CHAdeMO ) and China (GB/T 20234.3, a separate DC connector standard), and none of their car manufacturers had signed up to CCS. However, China had been involved in early stages of the development of the extra DC pins. [ 16 ] Volkswagen built the first public CCS quick-charge station, providing 50\u00a0kW\u00a0DC, in Wolfsburg in June 2013 to test drive the VW E-Up that was to be delivered with a DC rapid charger connector for CCS. [ 19 ] Two weeks later, BMW opened its first CCS rapid charge station to support the BMW i3 . [ 20 ] Since at least the second EV World Summit in June 2013, the CHAdeMO association, Volkswagen and Nissan all advocate multi-standard DC chargers, as the additional cost of a dual-protocol station is only 5%. [ 21 ] Since 2014, the European Union has required the provision of Type 2 or Combo 2 within the European electric vehicle charging network . In Germany, the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. ( CharIN ) was founded by car makers and suppliers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Mennekes, Opel, Phoenix Contact, Porsche, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD and Volkswagen) to promote the adoption of CCS. They noted in a press release that most cars could not charge faster than 50\u00a0kW, so that was the first common power output of CCS stations to be built during 2015. The next step was the standardization of stations with 150\u00a0kW output that they showed in October 2015, looking to a future system with 350\u00a0kW output. [ 22 ] Volvo joined CharIN in 2016; [ 23 ] Tesla in March 2016; [ 24 ] Lucid Motors (previously Atieva) June 2016; [ 25 ] Faraday Future June 2016; and Toyota in March 2017. [ 26 ] In the United States, BMW and VW stated in April 2016 that the East Coast and West Coast corridors had \"complete\" CCS networks. [ 27 ] As part of the 2016 settlement of the Volkswagen emissions scandal , VW committed to spend US$2\u00a0billion in the United States over the following 10 years on CCS and other charging infrastructure through subsidiary company Electrify America . [ 28 ] In this effort, charging stations would be built with up to 150\u00a0kW at community-based locations and with up to 350\u00a0kW at highway locations. Besides CCS, CHAdeMO charging stations were to be constructed. [ 29 ] In November 2016, Ford, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche and BMW announced they would build a 350\u00a0kW (up to 500 A and 920 V) charge network ( IONITY ) with 400 stations in Europe, [ 30 ] at a cost of \u20ac200,000 ($220,000) each. [ 31 ] Most electric cars have a battery pack voltage below 400 volts. With a maximum charge current of 500 A, up to 220 kW charging is possible. EVSE manufacturers offer CCS chargers capable of outputs beyond 350\u00a0kW. The Terra 360 [ 32 ] from ABB supports up to 360\u00a0kW charging. CCS chargers capable of 400\u00a0kW charging include: The Axon Easy 400 [ 33 ] from Ekoenergetyka The HYC400 [ 34 ] [ 35 ] from Alpitronic The Troniq High Power [ 36 ] from EVBox The Raption 400 HPC [ 37 ] from Circontrol The 400\u00a0kW DP + 600\u00a0kW PC [ 38 ] from SK Signet The Liquid Cooled Satellite [ 39 ] [ 40 ] from Kempower In October 2019, Repsol deployed 400\u00a0kW CCS chargers near the A-8 motorway at Abanto-Zierbena , Biscay, Spain. [ 41 ] In May 2022, EUROLOOP announced 720\u00a0kW charger WILLBERT Amber II S-HUB to be deployed in 2023 across Belgium. [ 42 ] In December 2022, Fastned deployed EVBox Troniq High Power 400\u00a0kW chargers in De Watering, The Netherlands, along the A8 near Oostzaan as part of its charging network. [ 43 ] In April 2023, Nxu demonstrated a battery-backed, 700\u00a0kW CCS charger [ 44 ] in Mesa, Arizona . In May 2023, Shell opened a new station [ 45 ] with 400\u00a0kW Kempower chargers in Lonelier outside Kristiansand , Norway. In June 2023, XC Power opened a station with QiOn Technology at Supercool Mobility Centers, a group of chargers with main power up to 990 kW with non-cooled CCS1 (up to 240 kW), and a charging station with liquid cooling system, up to 990 kW in Puebla City , Mexico. [ 46 ] In first half of 2023, both Ford and General Motors announced that they would transition their North American EV lines from CCS1 to the NACS charge connector beginning with the 2025 model year. [ 4 ] These company moves to a competing charging standard prompted a response from the Charging Interface Initiative (CharIN) association, which promotes the CCS standard. They pointed out in June 2023 that \"NACS is not a published or recognized standard by any standards body. For any technology to become a standard it has to go through due process in a standards development organization , such as ISO, IEC, and/or SAE.\" [ 47 ] A week later, SAE announced that it had standardized the NACS connector. [ 48 ] Technical design [ edit ] Terminology for charging components [ 8 ] Versions of the specifications [ edit ] The Combined Charging System is meant to develop with the needs of the customer. Version 1.0 covered the currently common features of AC and DC charging, and version 2.0 addressed the near to midterm future. The specifications and underlying standards for CCS 1.0 and CCS 2.0 are described for DC charging in Table 1 [ citation needed ] and for AC charging in Table 2. [ 49 ] The automotive manufacturers supporting CCS committed themselves to migrate to CCS 2.0 in 2018. [ citation needed ] Thus it is recommended for charging station manufacturers to also support CCS 2.0 from 2018 onwards. The specifications of CCS 3.0 were not yet precisely defined [ as of? ] . All features of previous versions shall be preserved to ensure backward compatibility. Potential additional features include: [ citation needed ] Reverse power transfer Inductive charging Wireless charging communication Bus charging with \"pantograph\" current collector Charging communication [ edit ] Unlike the connector and inlet, which depend on the geographical location, the charging communication is the same around the globe. Generally two types of communication can be differentiated. Basic signaling (BS) is done using a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal which is transferred over the control pilot (CP) contact according to IEC 61851-1 . This communication is used for safety-related functions, indicating for example if the connector is plugged in, before contacts are made live (or energized) and if both charging station and electric vehicle are ready for charging. AC charging is possible using the PWM signal only. In this case the charging station uses the duty cycle of the PWM to inform the onboard charger of the maximum available current at the charging station (A pulse width of 5% indicates that HLC shall be used). High-level communication (HLC) is done by modulating a high-frequency signal over the CP contact (also known as Power Line Communication or PLC) to transfer more complex information, which may be used e.g. for DC charging or for other services such as \"plug and charge\" or load balancing . High-level communication is based on the standard DIN SPEC 70121 and the ISO/IEC 15118-series . Load balancing [ edit ] CCS differentiates between two methods of load balancing. [ citation needed ] Reactive load balancing allows changing the energy flow from Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) to EV instantaneously to a specific limit. Scheduled load balancing supports reactive load balancing and additionally a planning of the energy flow from EVSE to EV with e.g. different power limits and cost indicators over time. It may for example be used to optimize energy distribution in a smart grid. Charging authorization modes [ edit ] For charge authorization, generally two approaches are foreseen. [ by whom? ] With \"plug and charge\", the user plugs in their vehicle and an automated authentication and authorization process is started without any further user interaction. Payment is performed automatically. With \"external payment\", the user has to identify with an RFID card at the terminal, or conduct a payment with a payment card, before they can proceed with charging. Vehicle coupler [ edit ] See also: SAE J1772 and Type 2 connector CCS Combo connectors Combo 1 Combo 2 Displayed approximately to scale. The vehicle coupler is composed of the vehicle connector, which is mounted at the end of a flexible cable, and the vehicle inlet, the counterpart of the connector, which is located within the vehicle. The CCS couplers were based on the Type 1 coupler, the North American standard, and Type 2 coupler, the European standard, as described in IEC 62196-2. One of the challenges of the Combined Charging System was to develop a vehicle inlet which is compatible with both the existing AC vehicle connectors and additional DC contacts. For both Type 1 and Type 2 this has been accomplished by extending the inlet with two additional DC contacts below the existing AC and communication contacts. The resulting new configurations are commonly known as Combo 1 and Combo 2. For the DC vehicle connector, the implementation varies slightly between Combo 1 and Combo 2. In the case of Combo 1 the connector is extended by two DC contacts, while the Type 1 portion of the connector remains the same with the AC contacts (L1 & N) being unused. For Combo 2 the AC contacts (L1, L2, L3 & N) are completely removed from the connector and therefore the Type 2 portion of the connector has only three contacts remaining \u2013 two communication contacts and a protective earth. The vehicle inlet may retain AC contacts to allow non-CCS AC charging. In both cases, communication and protective earth functions are covered by the original Type 1 or 2 portion of the connector. The Type 1 and Type 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-2, while the Combo 1 and Combo 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-3 as Configurations EE and FF. [ citation needed ] Mating table for type 1 and combo 1 coupler Cable connector Type 1 Combo 1 Vehicle inlet Type 1 AC charging, single phase Does not mate Combo 1 DC charging Mating table for type 2 and combo 2 coupler Cable connector Type 2 Combo 2 Vehicle inlet Type 2 AC charging, single phase or three phase Does not mate Combo 2 DC charging High-power charging [ edit ] Main article: Megawatt Charging System As vehicle couplers for DC charging according to IEC 62196-3:2014 Ed.1 allow DC charging only with currents up to 200 A, they do not sufficiently cover the needs of the future charging infrastructure. Consequently, a later edition of the standard supports currents of up to 500 A. Such high currents, however, either require large cable cross-sections, leading to heavy and stiff cables, or require cooling if thinner cables are desired. In addition, contact resistance leads to more heat dissipation. To cope with these technical issues, the standard IEC TS 62196-3-1 describes the requirements for high-power DC couplers including thermal sensing, cooling and silver-plating of contacts. [ 50 ] CharIN are investigating versions over 2 MW for electric trucks, and equipment is being tested. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Competition for global acceptance [ edit ] The Combined Charging System is primarily driven by European and North American car manufacturers. Type 1 and Combo 1 chargers are primarily found in North and Central America, Korea and Taiwan, while Type 2 and Combo 2 can be found in Europe, South America, South Africa, Arabia, India, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Oceania and Australia. For DC charging the competing standard GB/T 20234-2015 is used in China, while Japan uses CHAdeMO . In the European Union, according to Directive 2014/94/EU [ 53 ] all high-power DC charging points installed after November 18, 2017, were to be equipped for interoperability purposes at least with Combo 2 connectors. [ citation needed ] However, this does not prohibit the provision of other charging points using e.g. CHAdeMO or AC Rapid . Until 2024, [ 54 ] the majority [ 55 ] of EVs sold in the United States were made by Tesla and did not natively support CCS charging. Tesla used a proprietary connector from the early-2010s through 2022, though newer Tesla cars also support CCS with a separately sold adapter. [ 56 ] In November 2022, Tesla renamed its previously proprietary charging connector to the North American Charging Standard (NACS), making the specifications available to other EV manufacturers and allowing it to support the same signalling standard as CCS. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] In 2023, Ford Motor Company , General Motors , and Rivian announced that they would use NACS instead of CCS connectors on all future North American BEV models. Vehicles will initially come with an adapter in 2024, but new models starting from 2025 would be built with native NACS ports. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Subsequently, other EV companies signed agreements for native NACS adoption, including Aptera , BMW Group , Fisker , Honda , Hyundai Motor Group , Jaguar , Lucid , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Polestar , Subaru , Toyota , and Volvo . Many major charging networks and charging equipment suppliers also announced support for NACS, including EVgo, FLO, ABB E-Mobility, and EverCharge. NACS was subsequently ratified internationally as standard SAE J3400. This has led to predictions that CCS1 will soon be obsolete, as it is bigger, heavier and more expensive than NACS. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Hilton Worldwide announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 EVSEs across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025. [ 68 ] In many other countries no standard is preferred yet, although CharIN recommended advanced Type 2 and Combo 2 in 2018.

It is an extension of the J1772 standard AC charging connector. CCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins Connectors: Incomplete Combo 2 (left) showing the two large direct current (DC) pins below, while the four alternating current (AC) pins for neutral and three-phase are removed, while the signal pins of Type 2 remain, compared to IEC Type 2 (right). Typical Combined Charging System (Combo 2) vehicle inlet CCS Combo 2 at European Tesla Model 3 vehicle inlet The Combined Charging System ( CCS ) is a charging station standard for plug-in electric vehicles that uses the Combo 1 ( CCS1 ) or Combo 2 ( CCS2 ) connectors, which are extensions of the IEC 62196 Type 1 and Type 2 alternating current (AC) connectors, respectively, each with two additional direct current (DC) contacts to allow high-power fast charging. CCS chargers can provide power to electric vehicle batteries at up to 500 kW (max.\u00a01000 V and 500 A ), [ 1 ] and in response to demands for even faster charging, 400 kW CCS chargers have been deployed by charging networks and 990 kW CCS chargers have been demonstrated. Electric vehicles and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) are considered CCS-capable if they support either AC or DC charging according to the CCS standards. Manufacturers that support CCS include BMW , Daimler , FCA , Jaguar , Groupe PSA , Honda , Hyundai , Kia , Mazda , MG , Nissan , Polestar , Renault , Rivian , Tesla , Mahindra , Tata Motors and Volkswagen Group , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] as well as Ford and General Motors for their 2024 North American EV models. [ 4 ] Chinese automakers such as BYD , Chery and Zeekr also export CCS2 vehicles for their overseas markets. The CCS standard allows AC charging using the Type 1 and Type 2 connector depending on the geographical region and the charging infrastructure available. This charging environment encompasses charging couplers, charging communication, charging stations, the electric vehicle and various functions for the charging process such as load balancing and charge authorization. Competing charging systems for high-power DC charging include CHAdeMO (widely used in Japan, previously used in North America and Europe), [ 5 ] GB/T (China), [ 6 ] and the North American Charging System developed by Tesla. [ 7 ] History [ edit ] The revival of interest in electric cars in the 1990s spurred deployment of charging stations .  Initially, these accessed the abundant AC mains electricity using a variety of plugs around the world. From 2003, the standardization in IEC 62196 of higher-current charging connectors brought about various systems: Type 1 was used primarily in North America and Japan, and Type 2 variants elsewhere. For DC charging, the SAE and European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) made a plan in 2011 to add common DC wires to the existing AC connector types such that there would be only one \"global envelope\" that fitted all DC charging stations. [ 8 ] Combo connector for DC charging (using only the signal pins of Type 2) and the Combo inlet on the vehicle (allowing also AC charging) Electric car charging with CCS The proposal for a \"Combined Charging System\" (CCS) was published at the 15th International VDI -Congress (Association of German Engineers) on 12 October 2011 in Baden-Baden . CCS defines a single connector pattern on the vehicle side that offers enough space for a Type 1 or Type 2 connector, along with space for a two-pin DC connector allowing charging at up to 200 amps. Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Porsche and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce CCS in mid-2012. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In May 2012, ACEA endorsed the standardization of the Combo 2 connector across the European Union . [ 11 ] ACEA were joined later that month by the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) and The Union of the Electricity Industry (EURELECTRIC). [ 12 ] Also that month, prototype implementations for up to 100\u00a0kW were shown at EVS26 in Los Angeles . [ 13 ] DC charging specifications in IEC\u00a062196-3 (2014) give a range up to 125\u00a0A at up to 850\u00a0V. [ 14 ] The seven auto makers also agreed in 2011 to use HomePlug GreenPHY as the communication protocol. [ 15 ] The prototype for the matching plug was developed by Phoenix Contact with the goal to withstand 10,000 connect cycles. [ 16 ] The standardization proposal was sent to the IEC in January 2011. [ 17 ] The request to use a PLC [ clarification needed ] protocol for Vehicle2Grid communication was made in September 2009 in a joint presentation of BMW, Daimler and VW at a California Air Resources Board ZEV Technology Symposium. [ 18 ] This competed with the CAN bus proposal from Japan (including CHAdeMO ) and China (GB/T 20234.3, a separate DC connector standard), and none of their car manufacturers had signed up to CCS. However, China had been involved in early stages of the development of the extra DC pins. [ 16 ] Volkswagen built the first public CCS quick-charge station, providing 50\u00a0kW\u00a0DC, in Wolfsburg in June 2013 to test drive the VW E-Up that was to be delivered with a DC rapid charger connector for CCS. [ 19 ] Two weeks later, BMW opened its first CCS rapid charge station to support the BMW i3 . [ 20 ] Since at least the second EV World Summit in June 2013, the CHAdeMO association, Volkswagen and Nissan all advocate multi-standard DC chargers, as the additional cost of a dual-protocol station is only 5%. [ 21 ] Since 2014, the European Union has required the provision of Type 2 or Combo 2 within the European electric vehicle charging network . In Germany, the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. ( CharIN ) was founded by car makers and suppliers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Mennekes, Opel, Phoenix Contact, Porsche, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD and Volkswagen) to promote the adoption of CCS. They noted in a press release that most cars could not charge faster than 50\u00a0kW, so that was the first common power output of CCS stations to be built during 2015. The next step was the standardization of stations with 150\u00a0kW output that they showed in October 2015, looking to a future system with 350\u00a0kW output. [ 22 ] Volvo joined CharIN in 2016; [ 23 ] Tesla in March 2016; [ 24 ] Lucid Motors (previously Atieva) June 2016; [ 25 ] Faraday Future June 2016; and Toyota in March 2017. [ 26 ] In the United States, BMW and VW stated in April 2016 that the East Coast and West Coast corridors had \"complete\" CCS networks. [ 27 ] As part of the 2016 settlement of the Volkswagen emissions scandal , VW committed to spend US$2\u00a0billion in the United States over the following 10 years on CCS and other charging infrastructure through subsidiary company Electrify America . [ 28 ] In this effort, charging stations would be built with up to 150\u00a0kW at community-based locations and with up to 350\u00a0kW at highway locations. Besides CCS, CHAdeMO charging stations were to be constructed. [ 29 ] In November 2016, Ford, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche and BMW announced they would build a 350\u00a0kW (up to 500 A and 920 V) charge network ( IONITY ) with 400 stations in Europe, [ 30 ] at a cost of \u20ac200,000 ($220,000) each. [ 31 ] Most electric cars have a battery pack voltage below 400 volts. With a maximum charge current of 500 A, up to 220 kW charging is possible. EVSE manufacturers offer CCS chargers capable of outputs beyond 350\u00a0kW. The Terra 360 [ 32 ] from ABB supports up to 360\u00a0kW charging. CCS chargers capable of 400\u00a0kW charging include: The Axon Easy 400 [ 33 ] from Ekoenergetyka The HYC400 [ 34 ] [ 35 ] from Alpitronic The Troniq High Power [ 36 ] from EVBox The Raption 400 HPC [ 37 ] from Circontrol The 400\u00a0kW DP + 600\u00a0kW PC [ 38 ] from SK Signet The Liquid Cooled Satellite [ 39 ] [ 40 ] from Kempower In October 2019, Repsol deployed 400\u00a0kW CCS chargers near the A-8 motorway at Abanto-Zierbena , Biscay, Spain. [ 41 ] In May 2022, EUROLOOP announced 720\u00a0kW charger WILLBERT Amber II S-HUB to be deployed in 2023 across Belgium. [ 42 ] In December 2022, Fastned deployed EVBox Troniq High Power 400\u00a0kW chargers in De Watering, The Netherlands, along the A8 near Oostzaan as part of its charging network. [ 43 ] In April 2023, Nxu demonstrated a battery-backed, 700\u00a0kW CCS charger [ 44 ] in Mesa, Arizona . In May 2023, Shell opened a new station [ 45 ] with 400\u00a0kW Kempower chargers in Lonelier outside Kristiansand , Norway. In June 2023, XC Power opened a station with QiOn Technology at Supercool Mobility Centers, a group of chargers with main power up to 990 kW with non-cooled CCS1 (up to 240 kW), and a charging station with liquid cooling system, up to 990 kW in Puebla City , Mexico. [ 46 ] In first half of 2023, both Ford and General Motors announced that they would transition their North American EV lines from CCS1 to the NACS charge connector beginning with the 2025 model year. [ 4 ] These company moves to a competing charging standard prompted a response from the Charging Interface Initiative (CharIN) association, which promotes the CCS standard. They pointed out in June 2023 that \"NACS is not a published or recognized standard by any standards body. For any technology to become a standard it has to go through due process in a standards development organization , such as ISO, IEC, and/or SAE.\" [ 47 ] A week later, SAE announced that it had standardized the NACS connector. [ 48 ] Technical design [ edit ] Terminology for charging components [ 8 ] Versions of the specifications [ edit ] The Combined Charging System is meant to develop with the needs of the customer. Version 1.0 covered the currently common features of AC and DC charging, and version 2.0 addressed the near to midterm future. The specifications and underlying standards for CCS 1.0 and CCS 2.0 are described for DC charging in Table 1 [ citation needed ] and for AC charging in Table 2. [ 49 ] The automotive manufacturers supporting CCS committed themselves to migrate to CCS 2.0 in 2018. [ citation needed ] Thus it is recommended for charging station manufacturers to also support CCS 2.0 from 2018 onwards. The specifications of CCS 3.0 were not yet precisely defined [ as of? ] . All features of previous versions shall be preserved to ensure backward compatibility. Potential additional features include: [ citation needed ] Reverse power transfer Inductive charging Wireless charging communication Bus charging with \"pantograph\" current collector Charging communication [ edit ] Unlike the connector and inlet, which depend on the geographical location, the charging communication is the same around the globe. Generally two types of communication can be differentiated. Basic signaling (BS) is done using a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal which is transferred over the control pilot (CP) contact according to IEC 61851-1 . This communication is used for safety-related functions, indicating for example if the connector is plugged in, before contacts are made live (or energized) and if both charging station and electric vehicle are ready for charging. AC charging is possible using the PWM signal only. In this case the charging station uses the duty cycle of the PWM to inform the onboard charger of the maximum available current at the charging station (A pulse width of 5% indicates that HLC shall be used). High-level communication (HLC) is done by modulating a high-frequency signal over the CP contact (also known as Power Line Communication or PLC) to transfer more complex information, which may be used e.g. for DC charging or for other services such as \"plug and charge\" or load balancing . High-level communication is based on the standard DIN SPEC 70121 and the ISO/IEC 15118-series . Load balancing [ edit ] CCS differentiates between two methods of load balancing. [ citation needed ] Reactive load balancing allows changing the energy flow from Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) to EV instantaneously to a specific limit. Scheduled load balancing supports reactive load balancing and additionally a planning of the energy flow from EVSE to EV with e.g. different power limits and cost indicators over time. It may for example be used to optimize energy distribution in a smart grid. Charging authorization modes [ edit ] For charge authorization, generally two approaches are foreseen. [ by whom? ] With \"plug and charge\", the user plugs in their vehicle and an automated authentication and authorization process is started without any further user interaction. Payment is performed automatically. With \"external payment\", the user has to identify with an RFID card at the terminal, or conduct a payment with a payment card, before they can proceed with charging. Vehicle coupler [ edit ] See also: SAE J1772 and Type 2 connector CCS Combo connectors Combo 1 Combo 2 Displayed approximately to scale. The vehicle coupler is composed of the vehicle connector, which is mounted at the end of a flexible cable, and the vehicle inlet, the counterpart of the connector, which is located within the vehicle. The CCS couplers were based on the Type 1 coupler, the North American standard, and Type 2 coupler, the European standard, as described in IEC 62196-2. One of the challenges of the Combined Charging System was to develop a vehicle inlet which is compatible with both the existing AC vehicle connectors and additional DC contacts. For both Type 1 and Type 2 this has been accomplished by extending the inlet with two additional DC contacts below the existing AC and communication contacts. The resulting new configurations are commonly known as Combo 1 and Combo 2. For the DC vehicle connector, the implementation varies slightly between Combo 1 and Combo 2. In the case of Combo 1 the connector is extended by two DC contacts, while the Type 1 portion of the connector remains the same with the AC contacts (L1 & N) being unused. For Combo 2 the AC contacts (L1, L2, L3 & N) are completely removed from the connector and therefore the Type 2 portion of the connector has only three contacts remaining \u2013 two communication contacts and a protective earth. The vehicle inlet may retain AC contacts to allow non-CCS AC charging. In both cases, communication and protective earth functions are covered by the original Type 1 or 2 portion of the connector. The Type 1 and Type 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-2, while the Combo 1 and Combo 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-3 as Configurations EE and FF. [ citation needed ] Mating table for type 1 and combo 1 coupler Cable connector Type 1 Combo 1 Vehicle inlet Type 1 AC charging, single phase Does not mate Combo 1 DC charging Mating table for type 2 and combo 2 coupler Cable connector Type 2 Combo 2 Vehicle inlet Type 2 AC charging, single phase or three phase Does not mate Combo 2 DC charging High-power charging [ edit ] Main article: Megawatt Charging System As vehicle couplers for DC charging according to IEC 62196-3:2014 Ed.1 allow DC charging only with currents up to 200 A, they do not sufficiently cover the needs of the future charging infrastructure. Consequently, a later edition of the standard supports currents of up to 500 A. Such high currents, however, either require large cable cross-sections, leading to heavy and stiff cables, or require cooling if thinner cables are desired. In addition, contact resistance leads to more heat dissipation. To cope with these technical issues, the standard IEC TS 62196-3-1 describes the requirements for high-power DC couplers including thermal sensing, cooling and silver-plating of contacts. [ 50 ] CharIN are investigating versions over 2 MW for electric trucks, and equipment is being tested. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Competition for global acceptance [ edit ] The Combined Charging System is primarily driven by European and North American car manufacturers. Type 1 and Combo 1 chargers are primarily found in North and Central America, Korea and Taiwan, while Type 2 and Combo 2 can be found in Europe, South America, South Africa, Arabia, India, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Oceania and Australia. For DC charging the competing standard GB/T 20234-2015 is used in China, while Japan uses CHAdeMO . In the European Union, according to Directive 2014/94/EU [ 53 ] all high-power DC charging points installed after November 18, 2017, were to be equipped for interoperability purposes at least with Combo 2 connectors. [ citation needed ] However, this does not prohibit the provision of other charging points using e.g. CHAdeMO or AC Rapid . Until 2024, [ 54 ] the majority [ 55 ] of EVs sold in the United States were made by Tesla and did not natively support CCS charging. Tesla used a proprietary connector from the early-2010s through 2022, though newer Tesla cars also support CCS with a separately sold adapter. [ 56 ] In November 2022, Tesla renamed its previously proprietary charging connector to the North American Charging Standard (NACS), making the specifications available to other EV manufacturers and allowing it to support the same signalling standard as CCS. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] In 2023, Ford Motor Company , General Motors , and Rivian announced that they would use NACS instead of CCS connectors on all future North American BEV models. Vehicles will initially come with an adapter in 2024, but new models starting from 2025 would be built with native NACS ports. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Subsequently, other EV companies signed agreements for native NACS adoption, including Aptera , BMW Group , Fisker , Honda , Hyundai Motor Group , Jaguar , Lucid , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Polestar , Subaru , Toyota , and Volvo . Many major charging networks and charging equipment suppliers also announced support for NACS, including EVgo, FLO, ABB E-Mobility, and EverCharge. NACS was subsequently ratified internationally as standard SAE J3400. This has led to predictions that CCS1 will soon be obsolete, as it is bigger, heavier and more expensive than NACS. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Hilton Worldwide announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 EVSEs across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025. [ 68 ] In many other countries no standard is preferred yet, although CharIN recommended advanced Type 2 and Combo 2 in 2018.

It is an extension of the J1772 standard AC charging connector. CCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins Connectors: Incomplete Combo 2 (left) showing the two large direct current (DC) pins below, while the four alternating current (AC) pins for neutral and three-phase are removed, while the signal pins of Type 2 remain, compared to IEC Type 2 (right). Typical Combined Charging System (Combo 2) vehicle inlet CCS Combo 2 at European Tesla Model 3 vehicle inlet The Combined Charging System ( CCS ) is a charging station standard for plug-in electric vehicles that uses the Combo 1 ( CCS1 ) or Combo 2 ( CCS2 ) connectors, which are extensions of the IEC 62196 Type 1 and Type 2 alternating current (AC) connectors, respectively, each with two additional direct current (DC) contacts to allow high-power fast charging. CCS chargers can provide power to electric vehicle batteries at up to 500 kW (max.\u00a01000 V and 500 A ), [ 1 ] and in response to demands for even faster charging, 400 kW CCS chargers have been deployed by charging networks and 990 kW CCS chargers have been demonstrated. Electric vehicles and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) are considered CCS-capable if they support either AC or DC charging according to the CCS standards. Manufacturers that support CCS include BMW , Daimler , FCA , Jaguar , Groupe PSA , Honda , Hyundai , Kia , Mazda , MG , Nissan , Polestar , Renault , Rivian , Tesla , Mahindra , Tata Motors and Volkswagen Group , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] as well as Ford and General Motors for their 2024 North American EV models. [ 4 ] Chinese automakers such as BYD , Chery and Zeekr also export CCS2 vehicles for their overseas markets. The CCS standard allows AC charging using the Type 1 and Type 2 connector depending on the geographical region and the charging infrastructure available. This charging environment encompasses charging couplers, charging communication, charging stations, the electric vehicle and various functions for the charging process such as load balancing and charge authorization. Competing charging systems for high-power DC charging include CHAdeMO (widely used in Japan, previously used in North America and Europe), [ 5 ] GB/T (China), [ 6 ] and the North American Charging System developed by Tesla. [ 7 ] History [ edit ] The revival of interest in electric cars in the 1990s spurred deployment of charging stations .  Initially, these accessed the abundant AC mains electricity using a variety of plugs around the world. From 2003, the standardization in IEC 62196 of higher-current charging connectors brought about various systems: Type 1 was used primarily in North America and Japan, and Type 2 variants elsewhere. For DC charging, the SAE and European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) made a plan in 2011 to add common DC wires to the existing AC connector types such that there would be only one \"global envelope\" that fitted all DC charging stations. [ 8 ] Combo connector for DC charging (using only the signal pins of Type 2) and the Combo inlet on the vehicle (allowing also AC charging) Electric car charging with CCS The proposal for a \"Combined Charging System\" (CCS) was published at the 15th International VDI -Congress (Association of German Engineers) on 12 October 2011 in Baden-Baden . CCS defines a single connector pattern on the vehicle side that offers enough space for a Type 1 or Type 2 connector, along with space for a two-pin DC connector allowing charging at up to 200 amps. Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Porsche and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce CCS in mid-2012. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In May 2012, ACEA endorsed the standardization of the Combo 2 connector across the European Union . [ 11 ] ACEA were joined later that month by the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) and The Union of the Electricity Industry (EURELECTRIC). [ 12 ] Also that month, prototype implementations for up to 100\u00a0kW were shown at EVS26 in Los Angeles . [ 13 ] DC charging specifications in IEC\u00a062196-3 (2014) give a range up to 125\u00a0A at up to 850\u00a0V. [ 14 ] The seven auto makers also agreed in 2011 to use HomePlug GreenPHY as the communication protocol. [ 15 ] The prototype for the matching plug was developed by Phoenix Contact with the goal to withstand 10,000 connect cycles. [ 16 ] The standardization proposal was sent to the IEC in January 2011. [ 17 ] The request to use a PLC [ clarification needed ] protocol for Vehicle2Grid communication was made in September 2009 in a joint presentation of BMW, Daimler and VW at a California Air Resources Board ZEV Technology Symposium. [ 18 ] This competed with the CAN bus proposal from Japan (including CHAdeMO ) and China (GB/T 20234.3, a separate DC connector standard), and none of their car manufacturers had signed up to CCS. However, China had been involved in early stages of the development of the extra DC pins. [ 16 ] Volkswagen built the first public CCS quick-charge station, providing 50\u00a0kW\u00a0DC, in Wolfsburg in June 2013 to test drive the VW E-Up that was to be delivered with a DC rapid charger connector for CCS. [ 19 ] Two weeks later, BMW opened its first CCS rapid charge station to support the BMW i3 . [ 20 ] Since at least the second EV World Summit in June 2013, the CHAdeMO association, Volkswagen and Nissan all advocate multi-standard DC chargers, as the additional cost of a dual-protocol station is only 5%. [ 21 ] Since 2014, the European Union has required the provision of Type 2 or Combo 2 within the European electric vehicle charging network . In Germany, the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. ( CharIN ) was founded by car makers and suppliers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Mennekes, Opel, Phoenix Contact, Porsche, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD and Volkswagen) to promote the adoption of CCS. They noted in a press release that most cars could not charge faster than 50\u00a0kW, so that was the first common power output of CCS stations to be built during 2015. The next step was the standardization of stations with 150\u00a0kW output that they showed in October 2015, looking to a future system with 350\u00a0kW output. [ 22 ] Volvo joined CharIN in 2016; [ 23 ] Tesla in March 2016; [ 24 ] Lucid Motors (previously Atieva) June 2016; [ 25 ] Faraday Future June 2016; and Toyota in March 2017. [ 26 ] In the United States, BMW and VW stated in April 2016 that the East Coast and West Coast corridors had \"complete\" CCS networks. [ 27 ] As part of the 2016 settlement of the Volkswagen emissions scandal , VW committed to spend US$2\u00a0billion in the United States over the following 10 years on CCS and other charging infrastructure through subsidiary company Electrify America . [ 28 ] In this effort, charging stations would be built with up to 150\u00a0kW at community-based locations and with up to 350\u00a0kW at highway locations. Besides CCS, CHAdeMO charging stations were to be constructed. [ 29 ] In November 2016, Ford, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche and BMW announced they would build a 350\u00a0kW (up to 500 A and 920 V) charge network ( IONITY ) with 400 stations in Europe, [ 30 ] at a cost of \u20ac200,000 ($220,000) each. [ 31 ] Most electric cars have a battery pack voltage below 400 volts. With a maximum charge current of 500 A, up to 220 kW charging is possible. EVSE manufacturers offer CCS chargers capable of outputs beyond 350\u00a0kW. The Terra 360 [ 32 ] from ABB supports up to 360\u00a0kW charging. CCS chargers capable of 400\u00a0kW charging include: The Axon Easy 400 [ 33 ] from Ekoenergetyka The HYC400 [ 34 ] [ 35 ] from Alpitronic The Troniq High Power [ 36 ] from EVBox The Raption 400 HPC [ 37 ] from Circontrol The 400\u00a0kW DP + 600\u00a0kW PC [ 38 ] from SK Signet The Liquid Cooled Satellite [ 39 ] [ 40 ] from Kempower In October 2019, Repsol deployed 400\u00a0kW CCS chargers near the A-8 motorway at Abanto-Zierbena , Biscay, Spain. [ 41 ] In May 2022, EUROLOOP announced 720\u00a0kW charger WILLBERT Amber II S-HUB to be deployed in 2023 across Belgium. [ 42 ] In December 2022, Fastned deployed EVBox Troniq High Power 400\u00a0kW chargers in De Watering, The Netherlands, along the A8 near Oostzaan as part of its charging network. [ 43 ] In April 2023, Nxu demonstrated a battery-backed, 700\u00a0kW CCS charger [ 44 ] in Mesa, Arizona . In May 2023, Shell opened a new station [ 45 ] with 400\u00a0kW Kempower chargers in Lonelier outside Kristiansand , Norway. In June 2023, XC Power opened a station with QiOn Technology at Supercool Mobility Centers, a group of chargers with main power up to 990 kW with non-cooled CCS1 (up to 240 kW), and a charging station with liquid cooling system, up to 990 kW in Puebla City , Mexico. [ 46 ] In first half of 2023, both Ford and General Motors announced that they would transition their North American EV lines from CCS1 to the NACS charge connector beginning with the 2025 model year. [ 4 ] These company moves to a competing charging standard prompted a response from the Charging Interface Initiative (CharIN) association, which promotes the CCS standard. They pointed out in June 2023 that \"NACS is not a published or recognized standard by any standards body. For any technology to become a standard it has to go through due process in a standards development organization , such as ISO, IEC, and/or SAE.\" [ 47 ] A week later, SAE announced that it had standardized the NACS connector. [ 48 ] Technical design [ edit ] Terminology for charging components [ 8 ] Versions of the specifications [ edit ] The Combined Charging System is meant to develop with the needs of the customer. Version 1.0 covered the currently common features of AC and DC charging, and version 2.0 addressed the near to midterm future. The specifications and underlying standards for CCS 1.0 and CCS 2.0 are described for DC charging in Table 1 [ citation needed ] and for AC charging in Table 2. [ 49 ] The automotive manufacturers supporting CCS committed themselves to migrate to CCS 2.0 in 2018. [ citation needed ] Thus it is recommended for charging station manufacturers to also support CCS 2.0 from 2018 onwards. The specifications of CCS 3.0 were not yet precisely defined [ as of? ] . All features of previous versions shall be preserved to ensure backward compatibility. Potential additional features include: [ citation needed ] Reverse power transfer Inductive charging Wireless charging communication Bus charging with \"pantograph\" current collector Charging communication [ edit ] Unlike the connector and inlet, which depend on the geographical location, the charging communication is the same around the globe. Generally two types of communication can be differentiated. Basic signaling (BS) is done using a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal which is transferred over the control pilot (CP) contact according to IEC 61851-1 . This communication is used for safety-related functions, indicating for example if the connector is plugged in, before contacts are made live (or energized) and if both charging station and electric vehicle are ready for charging. AC charging is possible using the PWM signal only. In this case the charging station uses the duty cycle of the PWM to inform the onboard charger of the maximum available current at the charging station (A pulse width of 5% indicates that HLC shall be used). High-level communication (HLC) is done by modulating a high-frequency signal over the CP contact (also known as Power Line Communication or PLC) to transfer more complex information, which may be used e.g. for DC charging or for other services such as \"plug and charge\" or load balancing . High-level communication is based on the standard DIN SPEC 70121 and the ISO/IEC 15118-series . Load balancing [ edit ] CCS differentiates between two methods of load balancing. [ citation needed ] Reactive load balancing allows changing the energy flow from Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) to EV instantaneously to a specific limit. Scheduled load balancing supports reactive load balancing and additionally a planning of the energy flow from EVSE to EV with e.g. different power limits and cost indicators over time. It may for example be used to optimize energy distribution in a smart grid. Charging authorization modes [ edit ] For charge authorization, generally two approaches are foreseen. [ by whom? ] With \"plug and charge\", the user plugs in their vehicle and an automated authentication and authorization process is started without any further user interaction. Payment is performed automatically. With \"external payment\", the user has to identify with an RFID card at the terminal, or conduct a payment with a payment card, before they can proceed with charging. Vehicle coupler [ edit ] See also: SAE J1772 and Type 2 connector CCS Combo connectors Combo 1 Combo 2 Displayed approximately to scale. The vehicle coupler is composed of the vehicle connector, which is mounted at the end of a flexible cable, and the vehicle inlet, the counterpart of the connector, which is located within the vehicle. The CCS couplers were based on the Type 1 coupler, the North American standard, and Type 2 coupler, the European standard, as described in IEC 62196-2. One of the challenges of the Combined Charging System was to develop a vehicle inlet which is compatible with both the existing AC vehicle connectors and additional DC contacts. For both Type 1 and Type 2 this has been accomplished by extending the inlet with two additional DC contacts below the existing AC and communication contacts. The resulting new configurations are commonly known as Combo 1 and Combo 2. For the DC vehicle connector, the implementation varies slightly between Combo 1 and Combo 2. In the case of Combo 1 the connector is extended by two DC contacts, while the Type 1 portion of the connector remains the same with the AC contacts (L1 & N) being unused. For Combo 2 the AC contacts (L1, L2, L3 & N) are completely removed from the connector and therefore the Type 2 portion of the connector has only three contacts remaining \u2013 two communication contacts and a protective earth. The vehicle inlet may retain AC contacts to allow non-CCS AC charging. In both cases, communication and protective earth functions are covered by the original Type 1 or 2 portion of the connector. The Type 1 and Type 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-2, while the Combo 1 and Combo 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-3 as Configurations EE and FF.

Consequently, a later edition of the standard supports currents of up to 500 A. Such high currents, however, either require large cable cross-sections, leading to heavy and stiff cables, or require cooling if thinner cables are desired. In addition, contact resistance leads to more heat dissipation. To cope with these technical issues, the standard IEC TS 62196-3-1 describes the requirements for high-power DC couplers including thermal sensing, cooling and silver-plating of contacts. [ 50 ] CharIN are investigating versions over 2 MW for electric trucks, and equipment is being tested. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Competition for global acceptance [ edit ] The Combined Charging System is primarily driven by European and North American car manufacturers. Type 1 and Combo 1 chargers are primarily found in North and Central America, Korea and Taiwan, while Type 2 and Combo 2 can be found in Europe, South America, South Africa, Arabia, India, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Oceania and Australia. For DC charging the competing standard GB/T 20234-2015 is used in China, while Japan uses CHAdeMO . In the European Union, according to Directive 2014/94/EU [ 53 ] all high-power DC charging points installed after November 18, 2017, were to be equipped for interoperability purposes at least with Combo 2 connectors. [ citation needed ] However, this does not prohibit the provision of other charging points using e.g. CHAdeMO or AC Rapid . Until 2024, [ 54 ] the majority [ 55 ] of EVs sold in the United States were made by Tesla and did not natively support CCS charging. Tesla used a proprietary connector from the early-2010s through 2022, though newer Tesla cars also support CCS with a separately sold adapter. [ 56 ] In November 2022, Tesla renamed its previously proprietary charging connector to the North American Charging Standard (NACS), making the specifications available to other EV manufacturers and allowing it to support the same signalling standard as CCS. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] In 2023, Ford Motor Company , General Motors , and Rivian announced that they would use NACS instead of CCS connectors on all future North American BEV models. Vehicles will initially come with an adapter in 2024, but new models starting from 2025 would be built with native NACS ports. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Subsequently, other EV companies signed agreements for native NACS adoption, including Aptera , BMW Group , Fisker , Honda , Hyundai Motor Group , Jaguar , Lucid , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Polestar , Subaru , Toyota , and Volvo . Many major charging networks and charging equipment suppliers also announced support for NACS, including EVgo, FLO, ABB E-Mobility, and EverCharge. NACS was subsequently ratified internationally as standard SAE J3400. This has led to predictions that CCS1 will soon be obsolete, as it is bigger, heavier and more expensive than NACS. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Hilton Worldwide announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 EVSEs across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025. [ 68 ] In many other countries no standard is preferred yet, although CharIN recommended advanced Type 2 and Combo 2 in 2018.

CCS1 (Combined Charging System Combo 1) plug as used in North America. It is an extension of the J1772 standard AC charging connector. CCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins Connectors: Incomplete Combo 2 (left) showing the two large direct current (DC) pins below, while the four alternating current (AC) pins for neutral and three-phase are removed, while the signal pins of Type 2 remain, compared to IEC Type 2 (right). Typical Combined Charging System (Combo 2) vehicle inlet CCS Combo 2 at European Tesla Model 3 vehicle inlet The Combined Charging System ( CCS ) is a charging station standard for plug-in electric vehicles that uses the Combo 1 ( CCS1 ) or Combo 2 ( CCS2 ) connectors, which are extensions of the IEC 62196 Type 1 and Type 2 alternating current (AC) connectors, respectively, each with two additional direct current (DC) contacts to allow high-power fast charging. CCS chargers can provide power to electric vehicle batteries at up to 500 kW (max.\u00a01000 V and 500 A ), [ 1 ] and in response to demands for even faster charging, 400 kW CCS chargers have been deployed by charging networks and 990 kW CCS chargers have been demonstrated. Electric vehicles and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) are considered CCS-capable if they support either AC or DC charging according to the CCS standards. Manufacturers that support CCS include BMW , Daimler , FCA , Jaguar , Groupe PSA , Honda , Hyundai , Kia , Mazda , MG , Nissan , Polestar , Renault , Rivian , Tesla , Mahindra , Tata Motors and Volkswagen Group , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] as well as Ford and General Motors for their 2024 North American EV models. [ 4 ] Chinese automakers such as BYD , Chery and Zeekr also export CCS2 vehicles for their overseas markets. The CCS standard allows AC charging using the Type 1 and Type 2 connector depending on the geographical region and the charging infrastructure available. This charging environment encompasses charging couplers, charging communication, charging stations, the electric vehicle and various functions for the charging process such as load balancing and charge authorization. Competing charging systems for high-power DC charging include CHAdeMO (widely used in Japan, previously used in North America and Europe), [ 5 ] GB/T (China), [ 6 ] and the North American Charging System developed by Tesla. [ 7 ] History [ edit ] The revival of interest in electric cars in the 1990s spurred deployment of charging stations .  Initially, these accessed the abundant AC mains electricity using a variety of plugs around the world. From 2003, the standardization in IEC 62196 of higher-current charging connectors brought about various systems: Type 1 was used primarily in North America and Japan, and Type 2 variants elsewhere. For DC charging, the SAE and European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) made a plan in 2011 to add common DC wires to the existing AC connector types such that there would be only one \"global envelope\" that fitted all DC charging stations. [ 8 ] Combo connector for DC charging (using only the signal pins of Type 2) and the Combo inlet on the vehicle (allowing also AC charging) Electric car charging with CCS The proposal for a \"Combined Charging System\" (CCS) was published at the 15th International VDI -Congress (Association of German Engineers) on 12 October 2011 in Baden-Baden . CCS defines a single connector pattern on the vehicle side that offers enough space for a Type 1 or Type 2 connector, along with space for a two-pin DC connector allowing charging at up to 200 amps. Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Porsche and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce CCS in mid-2012. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In May 2012, ACEA endorsed the standardization of the Combo 2 connector across the European Union . [ 11 ] ACEA were joined later that month by the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) and The Union of the Electricity Industry (EURELECTRIC). [ 12 ] Also that month, prototype implementations for up to 100\u00a0kW were shown at EVS26 in Los Angeles . [ 13 ] DC charging specifications in IEC\u00a062196-3 (2014) give a range up to 125\u00a0A at up to 850\u00a0V. [ 14 ] The seven auto makers also agreed in 2011 to use HomePlug GreenPHY as the communication protocol. [ 15 ] The prototype for the matching plug was developed by Phoenix Contact with the goal to withstand 10,000 connect cycles. [ 16 ] The standardization proposal was sent to the IEC in January 2011. [ 17 ] The request to use a PLC [ clarification needed ] protocol for Vehicle2Grid communication was made in September 2009 in a joint presentation of BMW, Daimler and VW at a California Air Resources Board ZEV Technology Symposium. [ 18 ] This competed with the CAN bus proposal from Japan (including CHAdeMO ) and China (GB/T 20234.3, a separate DC connector standard), and none of their car manufacturers had signed up to CCS. However, China had been involved in early stages of the development of the extra DC pins. [ 16 ] Volkswagen built the first public CCS quick-charge station, providing 50\u00a0kW\u00a0DC, in Wolfsburg in June 2013 to test drive the VW E-Up that was to be delivered with a DC rapid charger connector for CCS. [ 19 ] Two weeks later, BMW opened its first CCS rapid charge station to support the BMW i3 . [ 20 ] Since at least the second EV World Summit in June 2013, the CHAdeMO association, Volkswagen and Nissan all advocate multi-standard DC chargers, as the additional cost of a dual-protocol station is only 5%. [ 21 ] Since 2014, the European Union has required the provision of Type 2 or Combo 2 within the European electric vehicle charging network . In Germany, the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. ( CharIN ) was founded by car makers and suppliers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Mennekes, Opel, Phoenix Contact, Porsche, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD and Volkswagen) to promote the adoption of CCS. They noted in a press release that most cars could not charge faster than 50\u00a0kW, so that was the first common power output of CCS stations to be built during 2015. The next step was the standardization of stations with 150\u00a0kW output that they showed in October 2015, looking to a future system with 350\u00a0kW output. [ 22 ] Volvo joined CharIN in 2016; [ 23 ] Tesla in March 2016; [ 24 ] Lucid Motors (previously Atieva) June 2016; [ 25 ] Faraday Future June 2016; and Toyota in March 2017. [ 26 ] In the United States, BMW and VW stated in April 2016 that the East Coast and West Coast corridors had \"complete\" CCS networks. [ 27 ] As part of the 2016 settlement of the Volkswagen emissions scandal , VW committed to spend US$2\u00a0billion in the United States over the following 10 years on CCS and other charging infrastructure through subsidiary company Electrify America . [ 28 ] In this effort, charging stations would be built with up to 150\u00a0kW at community-based locations and with up to 350\u00a0kW at highway locations. Besides CCS, CHAdeMO charging stations were to be constructed. [ 29 ] In November 2016, Ford, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche and BMW announced they would build a 350\u00a0kW (up to 500 A and 920 V) charge network ( IONITY ) with 400 stations in Europe, [ 30 ] at a cost of \u20ac200,000 ($220,000) each. [ 31 ] Most electric cars have a battery pack voltage below 400 volts. With a maximum charge current of 500 A, up to 220 kW charging is possible. EVSE manufacturers offer CCS chargers capable of outputs beyond 350\u00a0kW. The Terra 360 [ 32 ] from ABB supports up to 360\u00a0kW charging. CCS chargers capable of 400\u00a0kW charging include: The Axon Easy 400 [ 33 ] from Ekoenergetyka The HYC400 [ 34 ] [ 35 ] from Alpitronic The Troniq High Power [ 36 ] from EVBox The Raption 400 HPC [ 37 ] from Circontrol The 400\u00a0kW DP + 600\u00a0kW PC [ 38 ] from SK Signet The Liquid Cooled Satellite [ 39 ] [ 40 ] from Kempower In October 2019, Repsol deployed 400\u00a0kW CCS chargers near the A-8 motorway at Abanto-Zierbena , Biscay, Spain. [ 41 ] In May 2022, EUROLOOP announced 720\u00a0kW charger WILLBERT Amber II S-HUB to be deployed in 2023 across Belgium. [ 42 ] In December 2022, Fastned deployed EVBox Troniq High Power 400\u00a0kW chargers in De Watering, The Netherlands, along the A8 near Oostzaan as part of its charging network. [ 43 ] In April 2023, Nxu demonstrated a battery-backed, 700\u00a0kW CCS charger [ 44 ] in Mesa, Arizona . In May 2023, Shell opened a new station [ 45 ] with 400\u00a0kW Kempower chargers in Lonelier outside Kristiansand , Norway. In June 2023, XC Power opened a station with QiOn Technology at Supercool Mobility Centers, a group of chargers with main power up to 990 kW with non-cooled CCS1 (up to 240 kW), and a charging station with liquid cooling system, up to 990 kW in Puebla City , Mexico. [ 46 ] In first half of 2023, both Ford and General Motors announced that they would transition their North American EV lines from CCS1 to the NACS charge connector beginning with the 2025 model year. [ 4 ] These company moves to a competing charging standard prompted a response from the Charging Interface Initiative (CharIN) association, which promotes the CCS standard. They pointed out in June 2023 that \"NACS is not a published or recognized standard by any standards body. For any technology to become a standard it has to go through due process in a standards development organization , such as ISO, IEC, and/or SAE.\" [ 47 ] A week later, SAE announced that it had standardized the NACS connector. [ 48 ] Technical design [ edit ] Terminology for charging components [ 8 ] Versions of the specifications [ edit ] The Combined Charging System is meant to develop with the needs of the customer. Version 1.0 covered the currently common features of AC and DC charging, and version 2.0 addressed the near to midterm future. The specifications and underlying standards for CCS 1.0 and CCS 2.0 are described for DC charging in Table 1 [ citation needed ] and for AC charging in Table 2. [ 49 ] The automotive manufacturers supporting CCS committed themselves to migrate to CCS 2.0 in 2018. [ citation needed ] Thus it is recommended for charging station manufacturers to also support CCS 2.0 from 2018 onwards. The specifications of CCS 3.0 were not yet precisely defined [ as of? ] . All features of previous versions shall be preserved to ensure backward compatibility. Potential additional features include: [ citation needed ] Reverse power transfer Inductive charging Wireless charging communication Bus charging with \"pantograph\" current collector Charging communication [ edit ] Unlike the connector and inlet, which depend on the geographical location, the charging communication is the same around the globe. Generally two types of communication can be differentiated. Basic signaling (BS) is done using a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal which is transferred over the control pilot (CP) contact according to IEC 61851-1 . This communication is used for safety-related functions, indicating for example if the connector is plugged in, before contacts are made live (or energized) and if both charging station and electric vehicle are ready for charging. AC charging is possible using the PWM signal only. In this case the charging station uses the duty cycle of the PWM to inform the onboard charger of the maximum available current at the charging station (A pulse width of 5% indicates that HLC shall be used). High-level communication (HLC) is done by modulating a high-frequency signal over the CP contact (also known as Power Line Communication or PLC) to transfer more complex information, which may be used e.g. for DC charging or for other services such as \"plug and charge\" or load balancing . High-level communication is based on the standard DIN SPEC 70121 and the ISO/IEC 15118-series . Load balancing [ edit ] CCS differentiates between two methods of load balancing. [ citation needed ] Reactive load balancing allows changing the energy flow from Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) to EV instantaneously to a specific limit. Scheduled load balancing supports reactive load balancing and additionally a planning of the energy flow from EVSE to EV with e.g. different power limits and cost indicators over time. It may for example be used to optimize energy distribution in a smart grid. Charging authorization modes [ edit ] For charge authorization, generally two approaches are foreseen. [ by whom? ] With \"plug and charge\", the user plugs in their vehicle and an automated authentication and authorization process is started without any further user interaction. Payment is performed automatically. With \"external payment\", the user has to identify with an RFID card at the terminal, or conduct a payment with a payment card, before they can proceed with charging. Vehicle coupler [ edit ] See also: SAE J1772 and Type 2 connector CCS Combo connectors Combo 1 Combo 2 Displayed approximately to scale. The vehicle coupler is composed of the vehicle connector, which is mounted at the end of a flexible cable, and the vehicle inlet, the counterpart of the connector, which is located within the vehicle. The CCS couplers were based on the Type 1 coupler, the North American standard, and Type 2 coupler, the European standard, as described in IEC 62196-2. One of the challenges of the Combined Charging System was to develop a vehicle inlet which is compatible with both the existing AC vehicle connectors and additional DC contacts. For both Type 1 and Type 2 this has been accomplished by extending the inlet with two additional DC contacts below the existing AC and communication contacts. The resulting new configurations are commonly known as Combo 1 and Combo 2. For the DC vehicle connector, the implementation varies slightly between Combo 1 and Combo 2. In the case of Combo 1 the connector is extended by two DC contacts, while the Type 1 portion of the connector remains the same with the AC contacts (L1 & N) being unused. For Combo 2 the AC contacts (L1, L2, L3 & N) are completely removed from the connector and therefore the Type 2 portion of the connector has only three contacts remaining \u2013 two communication contacts and a protective earth. The vehicle inlet may retain AC contacts to allow non-CCS AC charging. In both cases, communication and protective earth functions are covered by the original Type 1 or 2 portion of the connector. The Type 1 and Type 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-2, while the Combo 1 and Combo 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-3 as Configurations EE and FF. [ citation needed ] Mating table for type 1 and combo 1 coupler Cable connector Type 1 Combo 1 Vehicle inlet Type 1 AC charging, single phase Does not mate Combo 1 DC charging Mating table for type 2 and combo 2 coupler Cable connector Type 2 Combo 2 Vehicle inlet Type 2 AC charging, single phase or three phase Does not mate Combo 2 DC charging High-power charging [ edit ] Main article: Megawatt Charging System As vehicle couplers for DC charging according to IEC 62196-3:2014 Ed.1 allow DC charging only with currents up to 200 A, they do not sufficiently cover the needs of the future charging infrastructure. Consequently, a later edition of the standard supports currents of up to 500 A. Such high currents, however, either require large cable cross-sections, leading to heavy and stiff cables, or require cooling if thinner cables are desired. In addition, contact resistance leads to more heat dissipation. To cope with these technical issues, the standard IEC TS 62196-3-1 describes the requirements for high-power DC couplers including thermal sensing, cooling and silver-plating of contacts. [ 50 ] CharIN are investigating versions over 2 MW for electric trucks, and equipment is being tested. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Competition for global acceptance [ edit ] The Combined Charging System is primarily driven by European and North American car manufacturers. Type 1 and Combo 1 chargers are primarily found in North and Central America, Korea and Taiwan, while Type 2 and Combo 2 can be found in Europe, South America, South Africa, Arabia, India, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Oceania and Australia. For DC charging the competing standard GB/T 20234-2015 is used in China, while Japan uses CHAdeMO . In the European Union, according to Directive 2014/94/EU [ 53 ] all high-power DC charging points installed after November 18, 2017, were to be equipped for interoperability purposes at least with Combo 2 connectors. [ citation needed ] However, this does not prohibit the provision of other charging points using e.g. CHAdeMO or AC Rapid . Until 2024, [ 54 ] the majority [ 55 ] of EVs sold in the United States were made by Tesla and did not natively support CCS charging. Tesla used a proprietary connector from the early-2010s through 2022, though newer Tesla cars also support CCS with a separately sold adapter. [ 56 ] In November 2022, Tesla renamed its previously proprietary charging connector to the North American Charging Standard (NACS), making the specifications available to other EV manufacturers and allowing it to support the same signalling standard as CCS. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] In 2023, Ford Motor Company , General Motors , and Rivian announced that they would use NACS instead of CCS connectors on all future North American BEV models. Vehicles will initially come with an adapter in 2024, but new models starting from 2025 would be built with native NACS ports. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Subsequently, other EV companies signed agreements for native NACS adoption, including Aptera , BMW Group , Fisker , Honda , Hyundai Motor Group , Jaguar , Lucid , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Polestar , Subaru , Toyota , and Volvo . Many major charging networks and charging equipment suppliers also announced support for NACS, including EVgo, FLO, ABB E-Mobility, and EverCharge. NACS was subsequently ratified internationally as standard SAE J3400. This has led to predictions that CCS1 will soon be obsolete, as it is bigger, heavier and more expensive than NACS. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Hilton Worldwide announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 EVSEs across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025. [ 68 ] In many other countries no standard is preferred yet, although CharIN recommended advanced Type 2 and Combo 2 in 2018.

It is an extension of the J1772 standard AC charging connector. CCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins Connectors: Incomplete Combo 2 (left) showing the two large direct current (DC) pins below, while the four alternating current (AC) pins for neutral and three-phase are removed, while the signal pins of Type 2 remain, compared to IEC Type 2 (right). Typical Combined Charging System (Combo 2) vehicle inlet CCS Combo 2 at European Tesla Model 3 vehicle inlet The Combined Charging System ( CCS ) is a charging station standard for plug-in electric vehicles that uses the Combo 1 ( CCS1 ) or Combo 2 ( CCS2 ) connectors, which are extensions of the IEC 62196 Type 1 and Type 2 alternating current (AC) connectors, respectively, each with two additional direct current (DC) contacts to allow high-power fast charging. CCS chargers can provide power to electric vehicle batteries at up to 500 kW (max.\u00a01000 V and 500 A ), [ 1 ] and in response to demands for even faster charging, 400 kW CCS chargers have been deployed by charging networks and 990 kW CCS chargers have been demonstrated. Electric vehicles and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) are considered CCS-capable if they support either AC or DC charging according to the CCS standards. Manufacturers that support CCS include BMW , Daimler , FCA , Jaguar , Groupe PSA , Honda , Hyundai , Kia , Mazda , MG , Nissan , Polestar , Renault , Rivian , Tesla , Mahindra , Tata Motors and Volkswagen Group , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] as well as Ford and General Motors for their 2024 North American EV models. [ 4 ] Chinese automakers such as BYD , Chery and Zeekr also export CCS2 vehicles for their overseas markets. The CCS standard allows AC charging using the Type 1 and Type 2 connector depending on the geographical region and the charging infrastructure available. This charging environment encompasses charging couplers, charging communication, charging stations, the electric vehicle and various functions for the charging process such as load balancing and charge authorization. Competing charging systems for high-power DC charging include CHAdeMO (widely used in Japan, previously used in North America and Europe), [ 5 ] GB/T (China), [ 6 ] and the North American Charging System developed by Tesla. [ 7 ] History [ edit ] The revival of interest in electric cars in the 1990s spurred deployment of charging stations .  Initially, these accessed the abundant AC mains electricity using a variety of plugs around the world. From 2003, the standardization in IEC 62196 of higher-current charging connectors brought about various systems: Type 1 was used primarily in North America and Japan, and Type 2 variants elsewhere. For DC charging, the SAE and European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) made a plan in 2011 to add common DC wires to the existing AC connector types such that there would be only one \"global envelope\" that fitted all DC charging stations. [ 8 ] Combo connector for DC charging (using only the signal pins of Type 2) and the Combo inlet on the vehicle (allowing also AC charging) Electric car charging with CCS The proposal for a \"Combined Charging System\" (CCS) was published at the 15th International VDI -Congress (Association of German Engineers) on 12 October 2011 in Baden-Baden . CCS defines a single connector pattern on the vehicle side that offers enough space for a Type 1 or Type 2 connector, along with space for a two-pin DC connector allowing charging at up to 200 amps. Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Porsche and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce CCS in mid-2012. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In May 2012, ACEA endorsed the standardization of the Combo 2 connector across the European Union . [ 11 ] ACEA were joined later that month by the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) and The Union of the Electricity Industry (EURELECTRIC). [ 12 ] Also that month, prototype implementations for up to 100\u00a0kW were shown at EVS26 in Los Angeles . [ 13 ] DC charging specifications in IEC\u00a062196-3 (2014) give a range up to 125\u00a0A at up to 850\u00a0V. [ 14 ] The seven auto makers also agreed in 2011 to use HomePlug GreenPHY as the communication protocol. [ 15 ] The prototype for the matching plug was developed by Phoenix Contact with the goal to withstand 10,000 connect cycles. [ 16 ] The standardization proposal was sent to the IEC in January 2011. [ 17 ] The request to use a PLC [ clarification needed ] protocol for Vehicle2Grid communication was made in September 2009 in a joint presentation of BMW, Daimler and VW at a California Air Resources Board ZEV Technology Symposium. [ 18 ] This competed with the CAN bus proposal from Japan (including CHAdeMO ) and China (GB/T 20234.3, a separate DC connector standard), and none of their car manufacturers had signed up to CCS. However, China had been involved in early stages of the development of the extra DC pins. [ 16 ] Volkswagen built the first public CCS quick-charge station, providing 50\u00a0kW\u00a0DC, in Wolfsburg in June 2013 to test drive the VW E-Up that was to be delivered with a DC rapid charger connector for CCS. [ 19 ] Two weeks later, BMW opened its first CCS rapid charge station to support the BMW i3 . [ 20 ] Since at least the second EV World Summit in June 2013, the CHAdeMO association, Volkswagen and Nissan all advocate multi-standard DC chargers, as the additional cost of a dual-protocol station is only 5%. [ 21 ] Since 2014, the European Union has required the provision of Type 2 or Combo 2 within the European electric vehicle charging network . In Germany, the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. ( CharIN ) was founded by car makers and suppliers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Mennekes, Opel, Phoenix Contact, Porsche, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD and Volkswagen) to promote the adoption of CCS. They noted in a press release that most cars could not charge faster than 50\u00a0kW, so that was the first common power output of CCS stations to be built during 2015. The next step was the standardization of stations with 150\u00a0kW output that they showed in October 2015, looking to a future system with 350\u00a0kW output. [ 22 ] Volvo joined CharIN in 2016; [ 23 ] Tesla in March 2016; [ 24 ] Lucid Motors (previously Atieva) June 2016; [ 25 ] Faraday Future June 2016; and Toyota in March 2017. [ 26 ] In the United States, BMW and VW stated in April 2016 that the East Coast and West Coast corridors had \"complete\" CCS networks. [ 27 ] As part of the 2016 settlement of the Volkswagen emissions scandal , VW committed to spend US$2\u00a0billion in the United States over the following 10 years on CCS and other charging infrastructure through subsidiary company Electrify America . [ 28 ] In this effort, charging stations would be built with up to 150\u00a0kW at community-based locations and with up to 350\u00a0kW at highway locations. Besides CCS, CHAdeMO charging stations were to be constructed. [ 29 ] In November 2016, Ford, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche and BMW announced they would build a 350\u00a0kW (up to 500 A and 920 V) charge network ( IONITY ) with 400 stations in Europe, [ 30 ] at a cost of \u20ac200,000 ($220,000) each. [ 31 ] Most electric cars have a battery pack voltage below 400 volts. With a maximum charge current of 500 A, up to 220 kW charging is possible. EVSE manufacturers offer CCS chargers capable of outputs beyond 350\u00a0kW. The Terra 360 [ 32 ] from ABB supports up to 360\u00a0kW charging. CCS chargers capable of 400\u00a0kW charging include: The Axon Easy 400 [ 33 ] from Ekoenergetyka The HYC400 [ 34 ] [ 35 ] from Alpitronic The Troniq High Power [ 36 ] from EVBox The Raption 400 HPC [ 37 ] from Circontrol The 400\u00a0kW DP + 600\u00a0kW PC [ 38 ] from SK Signet The Liquid Cooled Satellite [ 39 ] [ 40 ] from Kempower In October 2019, Repsol deployed 400\u00a0kW CCS chargers near the A-8 motorway at Abanto-Zierbena , Biscay, Spain. [ 41 ] In May 2022, EUROLOOP announced 720\u00a0kW charger WILLBERT Amber II S-HUB to be deployed in 2023 across Belgium. [ 42 ] In December 2022, Fastned deployed EVBox Troniq High Power 400\u00a0kW chargers in De Watering, The Netherlands, along the A8 near Oostzaan as part of its charging network. [ 43 ] In April 2023, Nxu demonstrated a battery-backed, 700\u00a0kW CCS charger [ 44 ] in Mesa, Arizona . In May 2023, Shell opened a new station [ 45 ] with 400\u00a0kW Kempower chargers in Lonelier outside Kristiansand , Norway. In June 2023, XC Power opened a station with QiOn Technology at Supercool Mobility Centers, a group of chargers with main power up to 990 kW with non-cooled CCS1 (up to 240 kW), and a charging station with liquid cooling system, up to 990 kW in Puebla City , Mexico. [ 46 ] In first half of 2023, both Ford and General Motors announced that they would transition their North American EV lines from CCS1 to the NACS charge connector beginning with the 2025 model year. [ 4 ] These company moves to a competing charging standard prompted a response from the Charging Interface Initiative (CharIN) association, which promotes the CCS standard. They pointed out in June 2023 that \"NACS is not a published or recognized standard by any standards body. For any technology to become a standard it has to go through due process in a standards development organization , such as ISO, IEC, and/or SAE.\" [ 47 ] A week later, SAE announced that it had standardized the NACS connector. [ 48 ] Technical design [ edit ] Terminology for charging components [ 8 ] Versions of the specifications [ edit ] The Combined Charging System is meant to develop with the needs of the customer. Version 1.0 covered the currently common features of AC and DC charging, and version 2.0 addressed the near to midterm future. The specifications and underlying standards for CCS 1.0 and CCS 2.0 are described for DC charging in Table 1 [ citation needed ] and for AC charging in Table 2. [ 49 ] The automotive manufacturers supporting CCS committed themselves to migrate to CCS 2.0 in 2018. [ citation needed ] Thus it is recommended for charging station manufacturers to also support CCS 2.0 from 2018 onwards. The specifications of CCS 3.0 were not yet precisely defined [ as of? ] . All features of previous versions shall be preserved to ensure backward compatibility. Potential additional features include: [ citation needed ] Reverse power transfer Inductive charging Wireless charging communication Bus charging with \"pantograph\" current collector Charging communication [ edit ] Unlike the connector and inlet, which depend on the geographical location, the charging communication is the same around the globe. Generally two types of communication can be differentiated. Basic signaling (BS) is done using a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal which is transferred over the control pilot (CP) contact according to IEC 61851-1 . This communication is used for safety-related functions, indicating for example if the connector is plugged in, before contacts are made live (or energized) and if both charging station and electric vehicle are ready for charging. AC charging is possible using the PWM signal only. In this case the charging station uses the duty cycle of the PWM to inform the onboard charger of the maximum available current at the charging station (A pulse width of 5% indicates that HLC shall be used). High-level communication (HLC) is done by modulating a high-frequency signal over the CP contact (also known as Power Line Communication or PLC) to transfer more complex information, which may be used e.g. for DC charging or for other services such as \"plug and charge\" or load balancing . High-level communication is based on the standard DIN SPEC 70121 and the ISO/IEC 15118-series . Load balancing [ edit ] CCS differentiates between two methods of load balancing. [ citation needed ] Reactive load balancing allows changing the energy flow from Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) to EV instantaneously to a specific limit. Scheduled load balancing supports reactive load balancing and additionally a planning of the energy flow from EVSE to EV with e.g. different power limits and cost indicators over time. It may for example be used to optimize energy distribution in a smart grid. Charging authorization modes [ edit ] For charge authorization, generally two approaches are foreseen. [ by whom? ] With \"plug and charge\", the user plugs in their vehicle and an automated authentication and authorization process is started without any further user interaction. Payment is performed automatically. With \"external payment\", the user has to identify with an RFID card at the terminal, or conduct a payment with a payment card, before they can proceed with charging. Vehicle coupler [ edit ] See also: SAE J1772 and Type 2 connector CCS Combo connectors Combo 1 Combo 2 Displayed approximately to scale. The vehicle coupler is composed of the vehicle connector, which is mounted at the end of a flexible cable, and the vehicle inlet, the counterpart of the connector, which is located within the vehicle. The CCS couplers were based on the Type 1 coupler, the North American standard, and Type 2 coupler, the European standard, as described in IEC 62196-2. One of the challenges of the Combined Charging System was to develop a vehicle inlet which is compatible with both the existing AC vehicle connectors and additional DC contacts. For both Type 1 and Type 2 this has been accomplished by extending the inlet with two additional DC contacts below the existing AC and communication contacts. The resulting new configurations are commonly known as Combo 1 and Combo 2. For the DC vehicle connector, the implementation varies slightly between Combo 1 and Combo 2. In the case of Combo 1 the connector is extended by two DC contacts, while the Type 1 portion of the connector remains the same with the AC contacts (L1 & N) being unused. For Combo 2 the AC contacts (L1, L2, L3 & N) are completely removed from the connector and therefore the Type 2 portion of the connector has only three contacts remaining \u2013 two communication contacts and a protective earth. The vehicle inlet may retain AC contacts to allow non-CCS AC charging. In both cases, communication and protective earth functions are covered by the original Type 1 or 2 portion of the connector. The Type 1 and Type 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-2, while the Combo 1 and Combo 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-3 as Configurations EE and FF. [ citation needed ] Mating table for type 1 and combo 1 coupler Cable connector Type 1 Combo 1 Vehicle inlet Type 1 AC charging, single phase Does not mate Combo 1 DC charging Mating table for type 2 and combo 2 coupler Cable connector Type 2 Combo 2 Vehicle inlet Type 2 AC charging, single phase or three phase Does not mate Combo 2 DC charging High-power charging [ edit ] Main article: Megawatt Charging System As vehicle couplers for DC charging according to IEC 62196-3:2014 Ed.1 allow DC charging only with currents up to 200 A, they do not sufficiently cover the needs of the future charging infrastructure. Consequently, a later edition of the standard supports currents of up to 500 A. Such high currents, however, either require large cable cross-sections, leading to heavy and stiff cables, or require cooling if thinner cables are desired. In addition, contact resistance leads to more heat dissipation. To cope with these technical issues, the standard IEC TS 62196-3-1 describes the requirements for high-power DC couplers including thermal sensing, cooling and silver-plating of contacts. [ 50 ] CharIN are investigating versions over 2 MW for electric trucks, and equipment is being tested. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Competition for global acceptance [ edit ] The Combined Charging System is primarily driven by European and North American car manufacturers. Type 1 and Combo 1 chargers are primarily found in North and Central America, Korea and Taiwan, while Type 2 and Combo 2 can be found in Europe, South America, South Africa, Arabia, India, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Oceania and Australia. For DC charging the competing standard GB/T 20234-2015 is used in China, while Japan uses CHAdeMO . In the European Union, according to Directive 2014/94/EU [ 53 ] all high-power DC charging points installed after November 18, 2017, were to be equipped for interoperability purposes at least with Combo 2 connectors. [ citation needed ] However, this does not prohibit the provision of other charging points using e.g. CHAdeMO or AC Rapid . Until 2024, [ 54 ] the majority [ 55 ] of EVs sold in the United States were made by Tesla and did not natively support CCS charging. Tesla used a proprietary connector from the early-2010s through 2022, though newer Tesla cars also support CCS with a separately sold adapter. [ 56 ] In November 2022, Tesla renamed its previously proprietary charging connector to the North American Charging Standard (NACS), making the specifications available to other EV manufacturers and allowing it to support the same signalling standard as CCS. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] In 2023, Ford Motor Company , General Motors , and Rivian announced that they would use NACS instead of CCS connectors on all future North American BEV models. Vehicles will initially come with an adapter in 2024, but new models starting from 2025 would be built with native NACS ports. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Subsequently, other EV companies signed agreements for native NACS adoption, including Aptera , BMW Group , Fisker , Honda , Hyundai Motor Group , Jaguar , Lucid , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Polestar , Subaru , Toyota , and Volvo . Many major charging networks and charging equipment suppliers also announced support for NACS, including EVgo, FLO, ABB E-Mobility, and EverCharge. NACS was subsequently ratified internationally as standard SAE J3400. This has led to predictions that CCS1 will soon be obsolete, as it is bigger, heavier and more expensive than NACS. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Hilton Worldwide announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 EVSEs across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025. [ 68 ] In many other countries no standard is preferred yet, although CharIN recommended advanced Type 2 and Combo 2 in 2018.

It is an extension of the J1772 standard AC charging connector. CCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins Connectors: Incomplete Combo 2 (left) showing the two large direct current (DC) pins below, while the four alternating current (AC) pins for neutral and three-phase are removed, while the signal pins of Type 2 remain, compared to IEC Type 2 (right). Typical Combined Charging System (Combo 2) vehicle inlet CCS Combo 2 at European Tesla Model 3 vehicle inlet The Combined Charging System ( CCS ) is a charging station standard for plug-in electric vehicles that uses the Combo 1 ( CCS1 ) or Combo 2 ( CCS2 ) connectors, which are extensions of the IEC 62196 Type 1 and Type 2 alternating current (AC) connectors, respectively, each with two additional direct current (DC) contacts to allow high-power fast charging. CCS chargers can provide power to electric vehicle batteries at up to 500 kW (max.\u00a01000 V and 500 A ), [ 1 ] and in response to demands for even faster charging, 400 kW CCS chargers have been deployed by charging networks and 990 kW CCS chargers have been demonstrated. Electric vehicles and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) are considered CCS-capable if they support either AC or DC charging according to the CCS standards. Manufacturers that support CCS include BMW , Daimler , FCA , Jaguar , Groupe PSA , Honda , Hyundai , Kia , Mazda , MG , Nissan , Polestar , Renault , Rivian , Tesla , Mahindra , Tata Motors and Volkswagen Group , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] as well as Ford and General Motors for their 2024 North American EV models. [ 4 ] Chinese automakers such as BYD , Chery and Zeekr also export CCS2 vehicles for their overseas markets. The CCS standard allows AC charging using the Type 1 and Type 2 connector depending on the geographical region and the charging infrastructure available. This charging environment encompasses charging couplers, charging communication, charging stations, the electric vehicle and various functions for the charging process such as load balancing and charge authorization. Competing charging systems for high-power DC charging include CHAdeMO (widely used in Japan, previously used in North America and Europe), [ 5 ] GB/T (China), [ 6 ] and the North American Charging System developed by Tesla. [ 7 ] History [ edit ] The revival of interest in electric cars in the 1990s spurred deployment of charging stations .  Initially, these accessed the abundant AC mains electricity using a variety of plugs around the world. From 2003, the standardization in IEC 62196 of higher-current charging connectors brought about various systems: Type 1 was used primarily in North America and Japan, and Type 2 variants elsewhere. For DC charging, the SAE and European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) made a plan in 2011 to add common DC wires to the existing AC connector types such that there would be only one \"global envelope\" that fitted all DC charging stations. [ 8 ] Combo connector for DC charging (using only the signal pins of Type 2) and the Combo inlet on the vehicle (allowing also AC charging) Electric car charging with CCS The proposal for a \"Combined Charging System\" (CCS) was published at the 15th International VDI -Congress (Association of German Engineers) on 12 October 2011 in Baden-Baden . CCS defines a single connector pattern on the vehicle side that offers enough space for a Type 1 or Type 2 connector, along with space for a two-pin DC connector allowing charging at up to 200 amps. Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Porsche and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce CCS in mid-2012. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In May 2012, ACEA endorsed the standardization of the Combo 2 connector across the European Union . [ 11 ] ACEA were joined later that month by the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) and The Union of the Electricity Industry (EURELECTRIC). [ 12 ] Also that month, prototype implementations for up to 100\u00a0kW were shown at EVS26 in Los Angeles . [ 13 ] DC charging specifications in IEC\u00a062196-3 (2014) give a range up to 125\u00a0A at up to 850\u00a0V. [ 14 ] The seven auto makers also agreed in 2011 to use HomePlug GreenPHY as the communication protocol. [ 15 ] The prototype for the matching plug was developed by Phoenix Contact with the goal to withstand 10,000 connect cycles. [ 16 ] The standardization proposal was sent to the IEC in January 2011. [ 17 ] The request to use a PLC [ clarification needed ] protocol for Vehicle2Grid communication was made in September 2009 in a joint presentation of BMW, Daimler and VW at a California Air Resources Board ZEV Technology Symposium. [ 18 ] This competed with the CAN bus proposal from Japan (including CHAdeMO ) and China (GB/T 20234.3, a separate DC connector standard), and none of their car manufacturers had signed up to CCS. However, China had been involved in early stages of the development of the extra DC pins. [ 16 ] Volkswagen built the first public CCS quick-charge station, providing 50\u00a0kW\u00a0DC, in Wolfsburg in June 2013 to test drive the VW E-Up that was to be delivered with a DC rapid charger connector for CCS. [ 19 ] Two weeks later, BMW opened its first CCS rapid charge station to support the BMW i3 . [ 20 ] Since at least the second EV World Summit in June 2013, the CHAdeMO association, Volkswagen and Nissan all advocate multi-standard DC chargers, as the additional cost of a dual-protocol station is only 5%. [ 21 ] Since 2014, the European Union has required the provision of Type 2 or Combo 2 within the European electric vehicle charging network . In Germany, the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. ( CharIN ) was founded by car makers and suppliers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Mennekes, Opel, Phoenix Contact, Porsche, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD and Volkswagen) to promote the adoption of CCS. They noted in a press release that most cars could not charge faster than 50\u00a0kW, so that was the first common power output of CCS stations to be built during 2015. The next step was the standardization of stations with 150\u00a0kW output that they showed in October 2015, looking to a future system with 350\u00a0kW output. [ 22 ] Volvo joined CharIN in 2016; [ 23 ] Tesla in March 2016; [ 24 ] Lucid Motors (previously Atieva) June 2016; [ 25 ] Faraday Future June 2016; and Toyota in March 2017. [ 26 ] In the United States, BMW and VW stated in April 2016 that the East Coast and West Coast corridors had \"complete\" CCS networks. [ 27 ] As part of the 2016 settlement of the Volkswagen emissions scandal , VW committed to spend US$2\u00a0billion in the United States over the following 10 years on CCS and other charging infrastructure through subsidiary company Electrify America . [ 28 ] In this effort, charging stations would be built with up to 150\u00a0kW at community-based locations and with up to 350\u00a0kW at highway locations. Besides CCS, CHAdeMO charging stations were to be constructed. [ 29 ] In November 2016, Ford, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche and BMW announced they would build a 350\u00a0kW (up to 500 A and 920 V) charge network ( IONITY ) with 400 stations in Europe, [ 30 ] at a cost of \u20ac200,000 ($220,000) each. [ 31 ] Most electric cars have a battery pack voltage below 400 volts. With a maximum charge current of 500 A, up to 220 kW charging is possible. EVSE manufacturers offer CCS chargers capable of outputs beyond 350\u00a0kW. The Terra 360 [ 32 ] from ABB supports up to 360\u00a0kW charging. CCS chargers capable of 400\u00a0kW charging include: The Axon Easy 400 [ 33 ] from Ekoenergetyka The HYC400 [ 34 ] [ 35 ] from Alpitronic The Troniq High Power [ 36 ] from EVBox The Raption 400 HPC [ 37 ] from Circontrol The 400\u00a0kW DP + 600\u00a0kW PC [ 38 ] from SK Signet The Liquid Cooled Satellite [ 39 ] [ 40 ] from Kempower In October 2019, Repsol deployed 400\u00a0kW CCS chargers near the A-8 motorway at Abanto-Zierbena , Biscay, Spain. [ 41 ] In May 2022, EUROLOOP announced 720\u00a0kW charger WILLBERT Amber II S-HUB to be deployed in 2023 across Belgium. [ 42 ] In December 2022, Fastned deployed EVBox Troniq High Power 400\u00a0kW chargers in De Watering, The Netherlands, along the A8 near Oostzaan as part of its charging network. [ 43 ] In April 2023, Nxu demonstrated a battery-backed, 700\u00a0kW CCS charger [ 44 ] in Mesa, Arizona . In May 2023, Shell opened a new station [ 45 ] with 400\u00a0kW Kempower chargers in Lonelier outside Kristiansand , Norway. In June 2023, XC Power opened a station with QiOn Technology at Supercool Mobility Centers, a group of chargers with main power up to 990 kW with non-cooled CCS1 (up to 240 kW), and a charging station with liquid cooling system, up to 990 kW in Puebla City , Mexico. [ 46 ] In first half of 2023, both Ford and General Motors announced that they would transition their North American EV lines from CCS1 to the NACS charge connector beginning with the 2025 model year. [ 4 ] These company moves to a competing charging standard prompted a response from the Charging Interface Initiative (CharIN) association, which promotes the CCS standard. They pointed out in June 2023 that \"NACS is not a published or recognized standard by any standards body. For any technology to become a standard it has to go through due process in a standards development organization , such as ISO, IEC, and/or SAE.\" [ 47 ] A week later, SAE announced that it had standardized the NACS connector. [ 48 ] Technical design [ edit ] Terminology for charging components [ 8 ] Versions of the specifications [ edit ] The Combined Charging System is meant to develop with the needs of the customer. Version 1.0 covered the currently common features of AC and DC charging, and version 2.0 addressed the near to midterm future. The specifications and underlying standards for CCS 1.0 and CCS 2.0 are described for DC charging in Table 1 [ citation needed ] and for AC charging in Table 2. [ 49 ] The automotive manufacturers supporting CCS committed themselves to migrate to CCS 2.0 in 2018. [ citation needed ] Thus it is recommended for charging station manufacturers to also support CCS 2.0 from 2018 onwards. The specifications of CCS 3.0 were not yet precisely defined [ as of? ] . All features of previous versions shall be preserved to ensure backward compatibility. Potential additional features include: [ citation needed ] Reverse power transfer Inductive charging Wireless charging communication Bus charging with \"pantograph\" current collector Charging communication [ edit ] Unlike the connector and inlet, which depend on the geographical location, the charging communication is the same around the globe. Generally two types of communication can be differentiated. Basic signaling (BS) is done using a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal which is transferred over the control pilot (CP) contact according to IEC 61851-1 . This communication is used for safety-related functions, indicating for example if the connector is plugged in, before contacts are made live (or energized) and if both charging station and electric vehicle are ready for charging. AC charging is possible using the PWM signal only. In this case the charging station uses the duty cycle of the PWM to inform the onboard charger of the maximum available current at the charging station (A pulse width of 5% indicates that HLC shall be used). High-level communication (HLC) is done by modulating a high-frequency signal over the CP contact (also known as Power Line Communication or PLC) to transfer more complex information, which may be used e.g. for DC charging or for other services such as \"plug and charge\" or load balancing . High-level communication is based on the standard DIN SPEC 70121 and the ISO/IEC 15118-series . Load balancing [ edit ] CCS differentiates between two methods of load balancing. [ citation needed ] Reactive load balancing allows changing the energy flow from Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) to EV instantaneously to a specific limit. Scheduled load balancing supports reactive load balancing and additionally a planning of the energy flow from EVSE to EV with e.g. different power limits and cost indicators over time. It may for example be used to optimize energy distribution in a smart grid. Charging authorization modes [ edit ] For charge authorization, generally two approaches are foreseen. [ by whom? ] With \"plug and charge\", the user plugs in their vehicle and an automated authentication and authorization process is started without any further user interaction. Payment is performed automatically. With \"external payment\", the user has to identify with an RFID card at the terminal, or conduct a payment with a payment card, before they can proceed with charging. Vehicle coupler [ edit ] See also: SAE J1772 and Type 2 connector CCS Combo connectors Combo 1 Combo 2 Displayed approximately to scale. The vehicle coupler is composed of the vehicle connector, which is mounted at the end of a flexible cable, and the vehicle inlet, the counterpart of the connector, which is located within the vehicle. The CCS couplers were based on the Type 1 coupler, the North American standard, and Type 2 coupler, the European standard, as described in IEC 62196-2. One of the challenges of the Combined Charging System was to develop a vehicle inlet which is compatible with both the existing AC vehicle connectors and additional DC contacts. For both Type 1 and Type 2 this has been accomplished by extending the inlet with two additional DC contacts below the existing AC and communication contacts. The resulting new configurations are commonly known as Combo 1 and Combo 2. For the DC vehicle connector, the implementation varies slightly between Combo 1 and Combo 2. In the case of Combo 1 the connector is extended by two DC contacts, while the Type 1 portion of the connector remains the same with the AC contacts (L1 & N) being unused. For Combo 2 the AC contacts (L1, L2, L3 & N) are completely removed from the connector and therefore the Type 2 portion of the connector has only three contacts remaining \u2013 two communication contacts and a protective earth. The vehicle inlet may retain AC contacts to allow non-CCS AC charging. In both cases, communication and protective earth functions are covered by the original Type 1 or 2 portion of the connector. The Type 1 and Type 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-2, while the Combo 1 and Combo 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-3 as Configurations EE and FF. [ citation needed ] Mating table for type 1 and combo 1 coupler Cable connector Type 1 Combo 1 Vehicle inlet Type 1 AC charging, single phase Does not mate Combo 1 DC charging Mating table for type 2 and combo 2 coupler Cable connector Type 2 Combo 2 Vehicle inlet Type 2 AC charging, single phase or three phase Does not mate Combo 2 DC charging High-power charging [ edit ] Main article: Megawatt Charging System As vehicle couplers for DC charging according to IEC 62196-3:2014 Ed.1 allow DC charging only with currents up to 200 A, they do not sufficiently cover the needs of the future charging infrastructure. Consequently, a later edition of the standard supports currents of up to 500 A. Such high currents, however, either require large cable cross-sections, leading to heavy and stiff cables, or require cooling if thinner cables are desired. In addition, contact resistance leads to more heat dissipation. To cope with these technical issues, the standard IEC TS 62196-3-1 describes the requirements for high-power DC couplers including thermal sensing, cooling and silver-plating of contacts. [ 50 ] CharIN are investigating versions over 2 MW for electric trucks, and equipment is being tested. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Competition for global acceptance [ edit ] The Combined Charging System is primarily driven by European and North American car manufacturers. Type 1 and Combo 1 chargers are primarily found in North and Central America, Korea and Taiwan, while Type 2 and Combo 2 can be found in Europe, South America, South Africa, Arabia, India, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Oceania and Australia. For DC charging the competing standard GB/T 20234-2015 is used in China, while Japan uses CHAdeMO . In the European Union, according to Directive 2014/94/EU [ 53 ] all high-power DC charging points installed after November 18, 2017, were to be equipped for interoperability purposes at least with Combo 2 connectors. [ citation needed ] However, this does not prohibit the provision of other charging points using e.g. CHAdeMO or AC Rapid . Until 2024, [ 54 ] the majority [ 55 ] of EVs sold in the United States were made by Tesla and did not natively support CCS charging. Tesla used a proprietary connector from the early-2010s through 2022, though newer Tesla cars also support CCS with a separately sold adapter. [ 56 ] In November 2022, Tesla renamed its previously proprietary charging connector to the North American Charging Standard (NACS), making the specifications available to other EV manufacturers and allowing it to support the same signalling standard as CCS. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] In 2023, Ford Motor Company , General Motors , and Rivian announced that they would use NACS instead of CCS connectors on all future North American BEV models. Vehicles will initially come with an adapter in 2024, but new models starting from 2025 would be built with native NACS ports. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Subsequently, other EV companies signed agreements for native NACS adoption, including Aptera , BMW Group , Fisker , Honda , Hyundai Motor Group , Jaguar , Lucid , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Polestar , Subaru , Toyota , and Volvo . Many major charging networks and charging equipment suppliers also announced support for NACS, including EVgo, FLO, ABB E-Mobility, and EverCharge. NACS was subsequently ratified internationally as standard SAE J3400. This has led to predictions that CCS1 will soon be obsolete, as it is bigger, heavier and more expensive than NACS. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Hilton Worldwide announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 EVSEs across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025. [ 68 ] In many other countries no standard is preferred yet, although CharIN recommended advanced Type 2 and Combo 2 in 2018.

CCS chargers can provide power to electric vehicle batteries at up to 500 kW (max.\u00a01000 V and 500 A ), [ 1 ] and in response to demands for even faster charging, 400 kW CCS chargers have been deployed by charging networks and 990 kW CCS chargers have been demonstrated.\nElectric vehicles and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) are considered CCS-capable if they support either AC or DC charging according to the CCS standards. Manufacturers that support CCS include BMW , Daimler , FCA , Jaguar , Groupe PSA , Honda , Hyundai , Kia , Mazda , MG , Nissan , Polestar , Renault , Rivian , Tesla , Mahindra , Tata Motors and Volkswagen Group , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] as well as Ford and General Motors for their 2024 North American EV models. [ 4 ] Chinese automakers such as BYD , Chery and Zeekr also export CCS2 vehicles for their overseas markets.\nThe CCS standard allows AC charging using the Type 1 and Type 2 connector depending on the geographical region and the charging infrastructure available. This charging environment encompasses charging couplers, charging communication, charging stations, the electric vehicle and various functions for the charging process such as load balancing and charge authorization. Competing charging systems for high-power DC charging include CHAdeMO (widely used in Japan, previously used in North America and Europe), [ 5 ] GB/T (China), [ 6 ] and the North American Charging System developed by Tesla. [ 7 ]\nHistory [ edit ]\nHistory\nThe revival of interest in electric cars in the 1990s spurred deployment of charging stations .  Initially, these accessed the abundant AC mains electricity using a variety of plugs around the world. From 2003, the standardization in IEC 62196 of higher-current charging connectors brought about various systems: Type 1 was used primarily in North America and Japan, and Type 2 variants elsewhere. For DC charging, the SAE and European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) made a plan in 2011 to add common DC wires to the existing AC connector types such that there would be only one \"global envelope\" that fitted all DC charging stations. [ 8 ]\nThe proposal for a \"Combined Charging System\" (CCS) was published at the 15th International VDI -Congress (Association of German Engineers) on 12 October 2011 in Baden-Baden . CCS defines a single connector pattern on the vehicle side that offers enough space for a Type 1 or Type 2 connector, along with space for a two-pin DC connector allowing charging at up to 200 amps. Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Porsche and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce CCS in mid-2012. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In May 2012, ACEA endorsed the standardization of the Combo 2 connector across the European Union . [ 11 ] ACEA were joined later that month by the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) and The Union of the Electricity Industry (EURELECTRIC). [ 12 ] Also that month, prototype implementations for up to 100\u00a0kW were shown at EVS26 in Los Angeles . [ 13 ] DC charging specifications in IEC\u00a062196-3 (2014) give a range up to 125\u00a0A at up to 850\u00a0V. [ 14 ]\nThe seven auto makers also agreed in 2011 to use HomePlug GreenPHY as the communication protocol. [ 15 ] The prototype for the matching plug was developed by Phoenix Contact with the goal to withstand 10,000 connect cycles. [ 16 ] The standardization proposal was sent to the IEC in January 2011. [ 17 ] The request to use a PLC [ clarification needed ] protocol for Vehicle2Grid communication was made in September 2009 in a joint presentation of BMW, Daimler and VW at a California Air Resources Board ZEV Technology Symposium. [ 18 ] This competed with the CAN bus proposal from Japan (including CHAdeMO ) and China (GB/T 20234.3, a separate DC connector standard), and none of their car manufacturers had signed up to CCS. However, China had been involved in early stages of the development of the extra DC pins. [ 16 ]\nVolkswagen built the first public CCS quick-charge station, providing 50\u00a0kW\u00a0DC, in Wolfsburg in June 2013 to test drive the VW E-Up that was to be delivered with a DC rapid charger connector for CCS. [ 19 ] Two weeks later, BMW opened its first CCS rapid charge station to support the BMW i3 . [ 20 ] Since at least the second EV World Summit in June 2013, the CHAdeMO association, Volkswagen and Nissan all advocate multi-standard DC chargers, as the additional cost of a dual-protocol station is only 5%. [ 21 ]\nSince 2014, the European Union has required the provision of Type 2 or Combo 2 within the European electric vehicle charging network .\nIn Germany, the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. ( CharIN ) was founded by car makers and suppliers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Mennekes, Opel, Phoenix Contact, Porsche, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD and Volkswagen) to promote the adoption of CCS. They noted in a press release that most cars could not charge faster than 50\u00a0kW, so that was the first common power output of CCS stations to be built during 2015. The next step was the standardization of stations with 150\u00a0kW output that they showed in October 2015, looking to a future system with 350\u00a0kW output. [ 22 ] Volvo joined CharIN in 2016; [ 23 ] Tesla in March 2016; [ 24 ] Lucid Motors (previously Atieva) June 2016; [ 25 ] Faraday Future June 2016; and Toyota in March 2017. [ 26 ]\nIn the United States, BMW and VW stated in April 2016 that the East Coast and West Coast corridors had \"complete\" CCS networks. [ 27 ] As part of the 2016 settlement of the Volkswagen emissions scandal , VW committed to spend US$2\u00a0billion in the United States over the following 10 years on CCS and other charging infrastructure through subsidiary company Electrify America . [ 28 ] In this effort, charging stations would be built with up to 150\u00a0kW at community-based locations and with up to 350\u00a0kW at highway locations. Besides CCS, CHAdeMO charging stations were to be constructed. [ 29 ]\nIn November 2016, Ford, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche and BMW announced they would build a 350\u00a0kW (up to 500 A and 920 V) charge network ( IONITY ) with 400 stations in Europe, [ 30 ] at a cost of \u20ac200,000 ($220,000) each. [ 31 ] Most electric cars have a battery pack voltage below 400 volts. With a maximum charge current of 500 A, up to 220 kW charging is possible.\nEVSE manufacturers offer CCS chargers capable of outputs beyond 350\u00a0kW. The Terra 360 [ 32 ] from ABB supports up to 360\u00a0kW charging.\nCCS chargers capable of 400\u00a0kW charging include:\nThe Axon Easy 400 [ 33 ] from Ekoenergetyka\nThe HYC400 [ 34 ] [ 35 ] from Alpitronic\nThe Troniq High Power [ 36 ] from EVBox\nThe Raption 400 HPC [ 37 ] from Circontrol\nThe 400\u00a0kW DP + 600\u00a0kW PC [ 38 ] from SK Signet\nThe Liquid Cooled Satellite [ 39 ] [ 40 ] from Kempower\nIn October 2019, Repsol deployed 400\u00a0kW CCS chargers near the A-8 motorway at Abanto-Zierbena , Biscay, Spain. [ 41 ]\nIn May 2022, EUROLOOP announced 720\u00a0kW charger WILLBERT Amber II S-HUB to be deployed in 2023 across Belgium. [ 42 ]\nIn December 2022, Fastned deployed EVBox Troniq High Power 400\u00a0kW chargers in De Watering, The Netherlands, along the A8 near Oostzaan as part of its charging network. [ 43 ]\nIn April 2023, Nxu demonstrated a battery-backed, 700\u00a0kW CCS charger [ 44 ] in Mesa, Arizona .\nIn May 2023, Shell opened a new station [ 45 ] with 400\u00a0kW Kempower chargers in Lonelier outside Kristiansand , Norway.\nIn June 2023, XC Power opened a station with QiOn Technology at Supercool Mobility Centers, a group of chargers with main power up to 990 kW with non-cooled CCS1 (up to 240 kW), and a charging station with liquid cooling system, up to 990 kW in Puebla City , Mexico. [ 46 ]\nIn first half of 2023, both Ford and General Motors announced that they would transition their North American EV lines from CCS1 to the NACS charge connector beginning with the 2025 model year. [ 4 ] These company moves to a competing charging standard prompted a response from the Charging Interface Initiative (CharIN) association, which promotes the CCS standard. They pointed out in June 2023 that \"NACS is not a published or recognized standard by any standards body. For any technology to become a standard it has to go through due process in a standards development organization , such as ISO, IEC, and/or SAE.\" [ 47 ] A week later, SAE announced that it had standardized the NACS connector. [ 48 ]\nTechnical design [ edit ]\nTechnical design\nVersions of the specifications [ edit ]\nVersions of the specifications\nThe Combined Charging System is meant to develop with the needs of the customer. Version 1.0 covered the currently common features of AC and DC charging, and version 2.0 addressed the near to midterm future. The specifications and underlying standards for CCS 1.0 and CCS 2.0 are described for DC charging in Table 1 [ citation needed ] and for AC charging in Table 2. [ 49 ]\nThe automotive manufacturers supporting CCS committed themselves to migrate to CCS 2.0 in 2018. [ citation needed ] Thus it is recommended for charging station manufacturers to also support CCS 2.0 from 2018 onwards.\nThe specifications of CCS 3.0 were not yet precisely defined [ as of? ] . All features of previous versions shall be preserved to ensure backward compatibility. Potential additional features include: [ citation needed ]\nReverse power transfer\nInductive charging\nWireless charging communication\nBus charging with \"pantograph\" current collector\nCharging communication [ edit ]\nCharging communication\nUnlike the connector and inlet, which depend on the geographical location, the charging communication is the same around the globe. Generally two types of communication can be differentiated.\nBasic signaling (BS) is done using a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal which is transferred over the control pilot (CP) contact according to IEC 61851-1 . This communication is used for safety-related functions, indicating for example if the connector is plugged in, before contacts are made live (or energized) and if both charging station and electric vehicle are ready for charging. AC charging is possible using the PWM signal only. In this case the charging station uses the duty cycle of the PWM to inform the onboard charger of the maximum available current at the charging station (A pulse width of 5% indicates that HLC shall be used).\nHigh-level communication (HLC) is done by modulating a high-frequency signal over the CP contact (also known as Power Line Communication or PLC) to transfer more complex information, which may be used e.g. for DC charging or for other services such as \"plug and charge\" or load balancing . High-level communication is based on the standard DIN SPEC 70121 and the ISO/IEC 15118-series .\nLoad balancing [ edit ]\nLoad balancing\nCCS differentiates between two methods of load balancing. [ citation needed ]\nReactive load balancing allows changing the energy flow from Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) to EV instantaneously to a specific limit.\nScheduled load balancing supports reactive load balancing and additionally a planning of the energy flow from EVSE to EV with e.g. different power limits and cost indicators over time. It may for example be used to optimize energy distribution in a smart grid.\nCharging authorization modes [ edit ]\nCharging authorization modes\nFor charge authorization, generally two approaches are foreseen. [ by whom? ]\nWith \"plug and charge\", the user plugs in their vehicle and an automated authentication and authorization process is started without any further user interaction. Payment is performed automatically.\nWith \"external payment\", the user has to identify with an RFID card at the terminal, or conduct a payment with a payment card, before they can proceed with charging.\nVehicle coupler [ edit ]\nVehicle coupler\nSee also: SAE J1772 and Type 2 connector\nCCS Combo connectors Combo 1 Combo 2 Displayed approximately to scale.\nCCS Combo connectors Combo 1 Combo 2 Displayed approximately to scale.\nCCS Combo connectors\nCCS Combo connectors\nCombo 1 Combo 2\nCombo 1\n\nCombo 1\nCombo 2\n\nCombo 2\nDisplayed approximately to scale.\nDisplayed approximately to scale.\nThe vehicle coupler is composed of the vehicle connector, which is mounted at the end of a flexible cable, and the vehicle inlet, the counterpart of the connector, which is located within the vehicle. The CCS couplers were based on the Type 1 coupler, the North American standard, and Type 2 coupler, the European standard, as described in IEC 62196-2. One of the challenges of the Combined Charging System was to develop a vehicle inlet which is compatible with both the existing AC vehicle connectors and additional DC contacts. For both Type 1 and Type 2 this has been accomplished by extending the inlet with two additional DC contacts below the existing AC and communication contacts. The resulting new configurations are commonly known as Combo 1 and Combo 2.\nFor the DC vehicle connector, the implementation varies slightly between Combo 1 and Combo 2. In the case of Combo 1 the connector is extended by two DC contacts, while the Type 1 portion of the connector remains the same with the AC contacts (L1 & N) being unused. For Combo 2 the AC contacts (L1, L2, L3 & N) are completely removed from the connector and therefore the Type 2 portion of the connector has only three contacts remaining \u2013 two communication contacts and a protective earth. The vehicle inlet may retain AC contacts to allow non-CCS AC charging.\nIn both cases, communication and protective earth functions are covered by the original Type 1 or 2 portion of the connector. The Type 1 and Type 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-2, while the Combo 1 and Combo 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-3 as Configurations EE and FF. [ citation needed ]\n\nHigh-power charging [ edit ]\nHigh-power charging\nMain article: Megawatt Charging System\nAs vehicle couplers for DC charging according to IEC 62196-3:2014 Ed.1 allow DC charging only with currents up to 200 A, they do not sufficiently cover the needs of the future charging infrastructure. Consequently, a later edition of the standard supports currents of up to 500 A. Such high currents, however, either require large cable cross-sections, leading to heavy and stiff cables, or require cooling if thinner cables are desired. In addition, contact resistance leads to more heat dissipation. To cope with these technical issues, the standard IEC TS 62196-3-1 describes the requirements for high-power DC couplers including thermal sensing, cooling and silver-plating of contacts. [ 50 ] CharIN are investigating versions over 2 MW for electric trucks, and equipment is being tested. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]\nCompetition for global acceptance [ edit ]\nCompetition for global acceptance\nThe Combined Charging System is primarily driven by European and North American car manufacturers. Type 1 and Combo 1 chargers are primarily found in North and Central America, Korea and Taiwan, while Type 2 and Combo 2 can be found in Europe, South America, South Africa, Arabia, India, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Oceania and Australia. For DC charging the competing standard GB/T 20234-2015 is used in China, while Japan uses CHAdeMO .\nIn the European Union, according to Directive 2014/94/EU [ 53 ] all high-power DC charging points installed after November 18, 2017, were to be equipped for interoperability purposes at least with Combo 2 connectors. [ citation needed ] However, this does not prohibit the provision of other charging points using e.g. CHAdeMO or AC Rapid .\nUntil 2024, [ 54 ] the majority [ 55 ] of EVs sold in the United States were made by Tesla and did not natively support CCS charging. Tesla used a proprietary connector from the early-2010s through 2022, though newer Tesla cars also support CCS with a separately sold adapter. [ 56 ] In November 2022, Tesla renamed its previously proprietary charging connector to the North American Charging Standard (NACS), making the specifications available to other EV manufacturers and allowing it to support the same signalling standard as CCS. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ]\nIn 2023, Ford Motor Company , General Motors , and Rivian announced that they would use NACS instead of CCS connectors on all future North American BEV models. Vehicles will initially come with an adapter in 2024, but new models starting from 2025 would be built with native NACS ports. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Subsequently, other EV companies signed agreements for native NACS adoption, including Aptera , BMW Group , Fisker , Honda , Hyundai Motor Group , Jaguar , Lucid , Mercedes-Benz , Nissan , Polestar , Subaru , Toyota , and Volvo . Many major charging networks and charging equipment suppliers also announced support for NACS, including EVgo, FLO, ABB E-Mobility, and EverCharge. NACS was subsequently ratified internationally as standard SAE J3400.\nThis has led to predictions that CCS1 will soon be obsolete, as it is bigger, heavier and more expensive than NACS. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ]\nHilton Worldwide announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 EVSEs across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025. [ 68 ]\nIn many other countries no standard is preferred yet, although CharIN recommended advanced Type 2 and Combo 2 in 2018.

SAE J1772 , also known as a J plug or Type 1 connector after its international standard, IEC 62196 Type 1, is a North American standard for electrical connectors for electric vehicles maintained by SAE International under the formal title \"SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice J1772, SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler\". [ 1 ] The SAE maintains the general physical, electrical, communication protocol, and performance requirements for the electric vehicle conductive charge system and coupler. The intent is to define a common electric vehicle conductive charging system architecture including operational requirements and the functional and dimensional requirements for the vehicle inlet and mating connector. The J1772 5-pin standard supports a wide range of single-phase (1\u03c6) alternating current (AC) charging rates. They range from portable devices that can connect to a household NEMA 5-15 outlet that can deliver 1.44\u00a0kW (12\u00a0A @ 120\u00a0V) to hardwired equipment that can deliver up to 19.2\u00a0kW (80\u00a0A @ 240\u00a0V). [ 2 ] These connectors are sometimes informally referred to as chargers, but they are \" electric vehicle supply equipment \" (EVSE), since they only supply AC power to the vehicle's on-board charger, which then converts it to the direct current (DC) needed to recharge the battery. The Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 1 connector builds on the standard, adding two additional pins for DC fast charging up to 350\u00a0kW. History [ edit ] The older Avcon connector, featured here on a Ford Ranger EV The main stimulus for the development of SAE J1772 came from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Early electric vehicles like the General Motors EV1 and Toyota RAV4 EV used Magne Charge (SAE J1773), an inductive system. CARB rejected the inductive technology in favor of conductive coupling to supply electricity for recharging. In June 2001, CARB adopted the SAE J1772-2001 standard as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] This early version of the connector was made by Avcon and featured a rectangular connector capable of delivering up to 6.6\u00a0kW of electrical power. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The California regulations mandated the usage of SAE J1772-2001 beginning with the 2006 model year. CARB would later ask for higher current delivery than the 6.6\u00a0kW that the 2001 J1772 (Avcon) standard supported. This process led to the proposal of a new round connector design by Yazaki which allowed for an increased power delivery of up to 19.2\u00a0kW delivered via single phase 120\u2013240 V AC at up to 80 amps. In 2008, CARB published a new standard that mandated the usage of the new connector beginning with the 2010 model year; [ 7 ] this was approved in 2012. [ 8 ] The Yazaki plug that was built to the new SAE J1772 plug standard successfully completed certification at UL . The standard specification was subsequently voted upon by the SAE committee in July 2009. [ 9 ] On January 14, 2010, the SAE J1772 REV 2009 was adopted by the SAE Motor Vehicle Council. [ 10 ] The companies participating in or supporting the revised 2009 standard include smart , Chrysler , GM , Ford , Toyota , Honda , Nissan , Rivian , and Tesla . The SAE J1772-2009 connector specification was subsequently added to the international IEC 62196-2 standard (\u201cPart 2: Dimensional compatibility and interchangeability requirements for a.c. pin and contact-tube accessories\u201d) with voting on the final specification slated to close in May 2011. [ 11 ] [ needs update ] The SAE J1772 connector is considered a \u201cType 1\u201d implementation providing a single phase coupler. [ 12 ] Vehicle equipment [ edit ] The SAE J1772-2009 was adopted by electric vehicle manufacturers in the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf . The connector became standard equipment in the U.S. market due to the availability of charging stations supporting it in the nation's electric vehicle network (helped by funding such as the ChargePoint America program drawing grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act). [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The European versions were equipped with a SAE J1772-2009 inlet as well until the automotive industry settled on the IEC Type 2 \u201cMennekes\u201d connector as the standard inlet\u00a0\u2013 since all IEC connectors use the same SAE J1772 signaling protocol the car manufacturers are selling cars with either a SAE J1772-2009 inlet or an IEC Type 2 inlet depending on the regional market. There are also (passive) adapters available that can convert J1772-2009 to IEC Type 2 and vice versa. The only difference is that most European versions have an on-board charger that can take advantage of three-phase electric power with higher voltage and current limits even for the same basic electric vehicle model (such as the Chevrolet Volt/Opel Ampera ). [ citation needed ] Combined Charging System (CCS) [ edit ] Main article: Combined Charging System CCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins In 2011, SAE developed a J1772/CCS Combo Coupler variant of the J1772-2009 connector in order to also support the Combined Charging System standard for direct current (DC) fast charging, which includes the standard 5-pin J1772 connector along with an additional two larger pins to support fast DC charging. Combo 1 accommodates charging at 200\u2013920 volts DC and up to 350\u00a0kW. [1] [ needs update ] The combination coupler will also use power-line communication technology to communicate between the vehicle, off-board charger, and smart grid. [ 15 ] Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Porsche, Volvo, and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce the Combined Charging System in mid-2012. [ 16 ] The first vehicles using the SAE Combo plug were the BMW i3 released in late 2013, and the Chevrolet Spark EV released in 2014. [ 17 ] In Europe, the combo coupler is based on the Type 2 (VDE) AC charging connector (Combo 2) maintaining full compatibility with the SAE specification for DC charging and the HomePlug Green PHY PLC protocol. [ 18 ] In 2019 Tesla introduced the Model 3 with a CCS Combo 2 plug in Europe, but has not introduced models with CCS in the US. With the introduction of the Model 3 in Europe, Tesla added CCS charging cables to V2 Superchargers (supporting both CCS Combo 2 and Tesla DC Type 2). European V3 Tesla Superchargers include only a CCS charging cable. [ 19 ] Properties [ edit ] Connector [ edit ] The J1772-2009 connector is designed for single phase alternating current electrical systems with 120\u00a0V or 240\u00a0V such as those used in North America and Japan. The round 43-millimetre (1.7\u00a0in) diameter connector is keyed and has five pins (viewed from outside of the plug): [ 20 ] SAE J1772 / IEC 62196-2-1 Type 1 Row Position Function Notes Top [ a ] 1 L1 \"AC Line 1\" 2 N \"AC Neutral\" for 120 V Level 1 charging or \"AC Line 2\" for 208\u2013240 V Level 2 charging Bottom [ b ] 3 PE \"Protective Earth\" aka Ground Middle [ c ] 4 PP \"Proximity Pilot\" aka \"plug present\", which provides a signal to the vehicle's control system so it can prevent movement while connected to the electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ; i.e., the charging station), and signals the latch release button to the vehicle. [ citation needed ] 5 CP \"Control Pilot\" is a communication line used to negotiate charging level between the car and the EVSE, and it can be manipulated by the vehicle to initiate charging and can carry other information. [ 21 ] The signal is a 1\u00a0kHz square wave at \u00b112 volts generated by the EVSE to detect the presence of the vehicle, communicate the maximum allowable charging current, and control charging begin/end. [ 22 ] ^ Top row is spaced 6.8\u00a0mm (0.27\u00a0in) above the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 15.7\u00a0mm (0.62\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. ^ Bottom row is spaced 10.6\u00a0mm (0.42\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector. ^ Middle row is spaced 5.6\u00a0mm (0.22\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 21.3\u00a0mm (0.84\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. The connector is designed to withstand 10,000 mating cycles (a connection and a disconnection) and exposure to the elements. With 1 mating cycle per day, the connector's lifespan should exceed 27 years. [ 23 ] Release mechanism [ edit ] Black release button on an SAE J1772 plug in a mockup car SAE J1772 plugs operated by thumb at a VinFast charging station Adaptor cable from Nissan with Type 1 plug for the car, Type 2 plug for a European charger socket IEC 62196 Type 2 connector with openings on the side for automatic release The SAE J1772 or Type 1 plug is locked into the car with a hook that is manually operated, mostly by pressing a button with the thumb, which interrupts power. This allows anybody to stop charging and even theft of the cable. To prevent this, the European IEC 62196 Type 2 connector has openings on the side for automatic locking and release, operated by the car owner via remote control. If the car locks or releases its plug, the charger will follow suit according to the PP signal. In addition, the charge port on many modern cars with a J1772 connector have an extendable pin that blocks the J1772 latch from being raised. By extending this pin, it becomes impossible to raise the release latch. In this way, the vehicle can prevent a plugged-in J1772 connector from being removed. This is essential for the CCS implementation where the connector is not designed to break the heavy DC charging current. Charging [ edit ] The SAE J1772-2017 standard defines four levels of charging: AC Level 1 , AC Level 2 , DC Level 1 , and DC Level 2 . [ 24 ] Earlier released revisions of J1772 also listed a never-implemented AC Level 3 , which was considered but never implemented. Charge method Voltage (V) Phase Max. current, continuous (A) Branch circuit breaker rating (A) [ a ] Max. power (kW) AC Level 1 120 1 12 15 1.44 16 20 1.92 AC Level 2 208 or 240 1 24\u201380 30\u2013100 5.0\u201319.2 AC Level 3 [ b ] 208\u2013600 3 63\u2013160 80-200 22.7\u2013166 Charge method Voltage (V) Phase Max. current (A) Max. power (kW) DC Level 1 50\u20131000 \u2013 80 80 DC Level 2 50\u20131000 \u2013 400 400 ^ Per NEC article 625.41, branch circuit rating must be at least 125% of EVSE maximum continuous current ^ As noted in Appendix M of the SAE J1772 standard document, a third AC charge method was considered but never implemented for light vehicles. For heavy and industrial vehicles, this was left to the SAE J3068 Medium and Heavy Duty Vehicle Conductive Charging Task Force Committee which permits the J1772 protocol at 400 VAC or less and requires a newer LIN protocol above 400 VAC (LIN is recommended at all voltages).  J3068 uses the Type 2 ( Mennekes connector ) possibly supplying up to 166\u00a0kW. [ 25 ] The J1772 AC Level 3 mode using single phase power would have provided up to 96\u00a0kW at a nominal voltage of 240 V AC and a maximum current of 400 A.  This power level is closer to what J3068 implemented a decade later at up to 600 VAC, although J3068 version 1 only supports up to 250 amps. For example, the 2020 Chevrolet Bolt has a 66-kWh lithium-ion battery and a 7.2-kW onboard charging module; with an EPA range of 259 miles (417\u00a0km) and energy efficiency of 118\u00a0mpg\u2011e (29\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0mi; 17.7\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0km), [ 26 ] it can use its portable charge cord to charge at AC Level 1 (120 V, 12 A) to get up to 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) of range per hour or go off an AC Level 2 charging unit (240 V, 32 A) to get up to 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) of range per hour. Using an optional DC fast charging (DCFC) port, this model can also charge at up to 55 kW to get up to 180\u00a0mi (290\u00a0km) of range per hour. Other EVs utilizing an 800\u00a0V battery architecture (such as those on Hyundai's E-GMP platform) can charge much faster. According to Hyundai, \"With a 350 kW DC charger, IONIQ 5 can charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. According to WLTP cycle, IONIQ 5 users only need to charge the vehicle for five minutes to get 100 km of range.\" [ 27 ] These vehicles are capable of accepting up to 230kW until about 50% State of charge , allowing these vehicles to recharge much quicker than similar EVs with lower voltage batteries. Some EVs have extended J1772 to allow AC Level 1 (120 V) charging at greater than 16 amps. This is useful, for example, at RV parks where TT-30 (\"Travel Trailer\" - 120 V, 30 A) receptacles are common. These allow charging at up to 24 amps. However, this level of 120 V charging has not been codified into J1772. Another extension, supported by the North American Charging System , is Level 2 charging at 277 V.  Like 208 V, 277 V is commonly found in North American commercial three-phase circuits. Safety [ edit ] The J1772 standard includes several levels of shock protection, ensuring the safety of charging even in wet conditions.  Physically, the connection pins are isolated on the interior of the connector when mated, ensuring no physical access to those pins.  When not mated, J1772 connectors have no power at the pins; [ 28 ] they are not energized until commanded by the vehicle. [ 29 ] The proximity detection pin is connected to a switch in the connector release button. Pressing the release button causes the vehicle to stop drawing current. As the connector is removed, the shorter control pilot pin disconnects first, causing the EVSE to drop power to the plug. This also ensures that the power pins will not be disconnected under load, causing arcs and shortening their life. The ground pin is longer than the other pins, so it breaks last. Signaling [ edit ] J1772 signaling circuit The signaling protocol has been designed for the following charging sequence. [ 29 ] supply equipment signals presence of AC input power vehicle detects plug via proximity circuit (thus the vehicle can prevent driving away while connected) and can detect when latch is pressed in preparation for plug removal. Control Pilot (CP) functions begin supply equipment detects plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) supply equipment indicates to PEV readiness to supply current PEV ventilation requirements are determined supply equipment current capacity provided to PEV PEV commands energy flow PEV and supply equipment continuously monitor continuity of safety ground charge continues as determined by PEV charge may be interrupted by disconnecting the plug from the vehicle The technical specification was described first in the 2001 version of SAE J1772 and subsequently the IEC 61851 -1 and IEC TS 62763:2013. The charging station puts 12\u00a0V on the Control Pilot (CP) and the Proximity Pilot (AKA Plug Present: PP) measuring the voltage differences. This protocol does not require integrated circuits, which would be required for other charging protocols, making the SAE J1772 robust and operable through a temperature range of \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to +85\u00a0\u00b0C. Control Pilot [ edit ] Control Pilot (Mode) : The charging station sends a 1\u00a0kHz square wave on the control pilot that is connected back to the protective earth on the vehicle side by means of a resistor and a diode (voltage range \u00b112.0\u00b10.4\u00a0V). The live wires of public charging stations are always dead if the CP\u2013PE ( Protective Earth ) circuit is open, although the standard allows a charging current as in Mode 1 (maximum 16\u00a0A). If the circuit is closed, the charging station can also verify that the protective earth is functional. The vehicle can request a certain charging function by setting the resistance between the CP and PE pins; 2.7\u00a0k\u03a9 announces a Mode 3 compatible vehicle ( vehicle detected ) which does not require charging. 880\u00a0\u03a9 says the vehicle is ready to be charged, and 240\u00a0\u03a9 requests with ventilation charging, in which case the charging stations supplies charging power only if the area is ventilated (i.e., outdoors). The Control Pilot line circuitry examples in SAE J1772:2001 show that the current loop CP\u2013PE is connected permanently on the vehicle side via a 2.74\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor, making for a voltage drop from +12\u00a0V to +9\u00a0V when a cable is hooked up to the charging station, which activates the wave generator. The charging is activated by the vehicle by adding parallel 1.3\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor resulting in a voltage drop to +6\u00a0V or by adding a parallel 270\u00a0\u03a9 resistor for a required ventilation resulting in a voltage drop to +3\u00a0V. Hence the charging station can react by only checking the voltage range present on the CP\u2013PE loop. [ 30 ] Note that the diode will only make for a voltage drop in the positive range; any negative voltage on the CP\u2013PE loop is blocked by D1 in the vehicle, any significant current that does flow in the CP\u2013PE loop during the negative period will shut off the current as being considered a fatal error (like touching the pins). For IEC62196-2 male plugs the Control Pilot pin is made shorter to prevent untethered cables being used as \"extension leads\", This prevents the use of downstream cables that may have a lower current capability being connected to a cable of a higher current rating.

[ 31 ] The PWM duty cycle of the 1\u00a0kHz CP signal indicates the maximum allowed mains current. According to the SAE it includes socket outlet, cable and vehicle inlet. In the US, the definition of the ampacity (ampere capacity, or current capacity) is split for continuous and short term operation. [ 31 ] The SAE defines the ampacity value to be derived by a formula based on the 1\u00a0ms full cycle (of the 1\u00a0kHz signal) with the maximum continuous ampere rating being 0.6\u00a0A per 10\u00a0\u03bcs up to 850\u00a0\u03bcs (with the lowest (100\u00a0\u03bcs/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 0.6\u00a0A = 6\u00a0A).  Above 850\u00a0\u03bcs, the formula requires subtraction of 640\u00a0\u03bcs and multiplying the difference by 2.5.  For example ((960\u00a0\u03bcs \u2212 640\u00a0\u03bcs)/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 2.5\u00a0A = 80\u00a0A.

During charging, the EVSE side connects the PP\u2013PE loop via S3 and a 150\u00a0\u03a9 R6; when opening the release actuator a 330\u00a0\u03a9 R7 is added in the PP\u2013PE loop on the EVSE side which gives a voltage shift on the line to allow the electric vehicle to initiate a controlled shut off prior to actual disconnection of the charge power pins. However, many low-power adapter cables do not offer that locking actuator state detection on the PP pin. Under IEC 62196 the Proximity Pin is also used to indicate the cable capacity \u2013 this is relevant for non-tethered EVSEs. The resistor is coded to the maximum current capability of the cable assembly. The EV interrupts the current supply if the current capability of the cable is exceeded as detected by the measurement of the Rc (shown as R6 in the J1772 signaling circuit above), as defined by the values for the recommended interpretation range. Rc is placed between the PP and PE, within the detachable cable assembly. Current capability of the cable assembly Rc (\u00b13%) Recommended interpretation range by the EVSE 13 A 1.5 k\u03a9 / 0.5 W 1\u20132.7 k\u03a9 20 A 680 \u03a9 / 0.5 W 330 \u03a9 \u2013 1 k\u03a9 32 A 220 \u03a9 / 1 W 150\u2013330 \u03a9 70 A single-phase / 63 A three-phase 100 \u03a9 / 1 W 50\u2013150 \u03a9 [ 32 ] P1901 powerline communication [ edit ] In an updated standard due in 2012, SAE proposes to use power line communication , specifically IEEE 1901 , between the vehicle, off-board charging station , and the smart grid , without requiring an additional pin; SAE and the IEEE Standards Association are sharing their draft standards related to the smart grid and vehicle electrification. [ 33 ] P1901 communication is compatible with other 802.x standards via the IEEE 1905 standard, allowing arbitrary IP-based communications with the vehicle, meter or distributor, and the building where chargers are located.  P1905 includes wireless communications. In at least one implementation, communication between the off-board DC EVSE and PEV occurs on the pilot wire of the SAE J1772 connector via HomePlug Green PHY power line communication (PLC). [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Competing standards [ edit ] A competing proposal known as the Mennekes connector initiated by RWE and Daimler was standardized in 2011's IEC 62196 as its Type 2 connector. It has been widely adopted as the European Union's standard single- and three-phase coupler. [ 12 ] [ 37 ] The connector adopted the same protocols for the pilot pin as J1772's J-Plug. The IEC specification allows for up to 63\u00a0A and 43.6\u00a0kW.  In 2018, the SAE J3068 committee released an enhancement to the EU connector tailored for the North American industrial market allowing up to 160\u00a0A / 166\u00a0kW on 3\u03c6 power . The same IEC\u00a062196-2 standard also specified a pair of Type 3 connector from Scame Global providing a single- and three-phase coupler with shutters. [ 12 ] After a 2016 approval by the IEC for a small modification to the Mennekes connector optionally allowing shutters, Type 3 has been deprecated. Tokyo Electric Power Company has developed a specification solely for automotive high-voltage DC fast charging using the JARI DC connector and formed the CHAdeMO ( charge de move , equivalent to \"charge for moving\") association with Japanese automakers Mitsubishi , Nissan and Subaru to promote it.

SAE J1772 , also known as a J plug or Type 1 connector after its international standard, IEC 62196 Type 1, is a North American standard for electrical connectors for electric vehicles maintained by SAE International under the formal title \"SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice J1772, SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler\". [ 1 ] The SAE maintains the general physical, electrical, communication protocol, and performance requirements for the electric vehicle conductive charge system and coupler. The intent is to define a common electric vehicle conductive charging system architecture including operational requirements and the functional and dimensional requirements for the vehicle inlet and mating connector. The J1772 5-pin standard supports a wide range of single-phase (1\u03c6) alternating current (AC) charging rates. They range from portable devices that can connect to a household NEMA 5-15 outlet that can deliver 1.44\u00a0kW (12\u00a0A @ 120\u00a0V) to hardwired equipment that can deliver up to 19.2\u00a0kW (80\u00a0A @ 240\u00a0V). [ 2 ] These connectors are sometimes informally referred to as chargers, but they are \" electric vehicle supply equipment \" (EVSE), since they only supply AC power to the vehicle's on-board charger, which then converts it to the direct current (DC) needed to recharge the battery. The Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 1 connector builds on the standard, adding two additional pins for DC fast charging up to 350\u00a0kW. History [ edit ] The older Avcon connector, featured here on a Ford Ranger EV The main stimulus for the development of SAE J1772 came from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Early electric vehicles like the General Motors EV1 and Toyota RAV4 EV used Magne Charge (SAE J1773), an inductive system. CARB rejected the inductive technology in favor of conductive coupling to supply electricity for recharging. In June 2001, CARB adopted the SAE J1772-2001 standard as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] This early version of the connector was made by Avcon and featured a rectangular connector capable of delivering up to 6.6\u00a0kW of electrical power. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The California regulations mandated the usage of SAE J1772-2001 beginning with the 2006 model year. CARB would later ask for higher current delivery than the 6.6\u00a0kW that the 2001 J1772 (Avcon) standard supported. This process led to the proposal of a new round connector design by Yazaki which allowed for an increased power delivery of up to 19.2\u00a0kW delivered via single phase 120\u2013240 V AC at up to 80 amps. In 2008, CARB published a new standard that mandated the usage of the new connector beginning with the 2010 model year; [ 7 ] this was approved in 2012. [ 8 ] The Yazaki plug that was built to the new SAE J1772 plug standard successfully completed certification at UL . The standard specification was subsequently voted upon by the SAE committee in July 2009. [ 9 ] On January 14, 2010, the SAE J1772 REV 2009 was adopted by the SAE Motor Vehicle Council. [ 10 ] The companies participating in or supporting the revised 2009 standard include smart , Chrysler , GM , Ford , Toyota , Honda , Nissan , Rivian , and Tesla . The SAE J1772-2009 connector specification was subsequently added to the international IEC 62196-2 standard (\u201cPart 2: Dimensional compatibility and interchangeability requirements for a.c. pin and contact-tube accessories\u201d) with voting on the final specification slated to close in May 2011. [ 11 ] [ needs update ] The SAE J1772 connector is considered a \u201cType 1\u201d implementation providing a single phase coupler. [ 12 ] Vehicle equipment [ edit ] The SAE J1772-2009 was adopted by electric vehicle manufacturers in the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf . The connector became standard equipment in the U.S. market due to the availability of charging stations supporting it in the nation's electric vehicle network (helped by funding such as the ChargePoint America program drawing grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act). [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The European versions were equipped with a SAE J1772-2009 inlet as well until the automotive industry settled on the IEC Type 2 \u201cMennekes\u201d connector as the standard inlet\u00a0\u2013 since all IEC connectors use the same SAE J1772 signaling protocol the car manufacturers are selling cars with either a SAE J1772-2009 inlet or an IEC Type 2 inlet depending on the regional market. There are also (passive) adapters available that can convert J1772-2009 to IEC Type 2 and vice versa. The only difference is that most European versions have an on-board charger that can take advantage of three-phase electric power with higher voltage and current limits even for the same basic electric vehicle model (such as the Chevrolet Volt/Opel Ampera ). [ citation needed ] Combined Charging System (CCS) [ edit ] Main article: Combined Charging System CCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins In 2011, SAE developed a J1772/CCS Combo Coupler variant of the J1772-2009 connector in order to also support the Combined Charging System standard for direct current (DC) fast charging, which includes the standard 5-pin J1772 connector along with an additional two larger pins to support fast DC charging. Combo 1 accommodates charging at 200\u2013920 volts DC and up to 350\u00a0kW. [1] [ needs update ] The combination coupler will also use power-line communication technology to communicate between the vehicle, off-board charger, and smart grid. [ 15 ] Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Porsche, Volvo, and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce the Combined Charging System in mid-2012. [ 16 ] The first vehicles using the SAE Combo plug were the BMW i3 released in late 2013, and the Chevrolet Spark EV released in 2014. [ 17 ] In Europe, the combo coupler is based on the Type 2 (VDE) AC charging connector (Combo 2) maintaining full compatibility with the SAE specification for DC charging and the HomePlug Green PHY PLC protocol. [ 18 ] In 2019 Tesla introduced the Model 3 with a CCS Combo 2 plug in Europe, but has not introduced models with CCS in the US. With the introduction of the Model 3 in Europe, Tesla added CCS charging cables to V2 Superchargers (supporting both CCS Combo 2 and Tesla DC Type 2). European V3 Tesla Superchargers include only a CCS charging cable. [ 19 ] Properties [ edit ] Connector [ edit ] The J1772-2009 connector is designed for single phase alternating current electrical systems with 120\u00a0V or 240\u00a0V such as those used in North America and Japan. The round 43-millimetre (1.7\u00a0in) diameter connector is keyed and has five pins (viewed from outside of the plug): [ 20 ] SAE J1772 / IEC 62196-2-1 Type 1 Row Position Function Notes Top [ a ] 1 L1 \"AC Line 1\" 2 N \"AC Neutral\" for 120 V Level 1 charging or \"AC Line 2\" for 208\u2013240 V Level 2 charging Bottom [ b ] 3 PE \"Protective Earth\" aka Ground Middle [ c ] 4 PP \"Proximity Pilot\" aka \"plug present\", which provides a signal to the vehicle's control system so it can prevent movement while connected to the electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ; i.e., the charging station), and signals the latch release button to the vehicle. [ citation needed ] 5 CP \"Control Pilot\" is a communication line used to negotiate charging level between the car and the EVSE, and it can be manipulated by the vehicle to initiate charging and can carry other information. [ 21 ] The signal is a 1\u00a0kHz square wave at \u00b112 volts generated by the EVSE to detect the presence of the vehicle, communicate the maximum allowable charging current, and control charging begin/end. [ 22 ] ^ Top row is spaced 6.8\u00a0mm (0.27\u00a0in) above the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 15.7\u00a0mm (0.62\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. ^ Bottom row is spaced 10.6\u00a0mm (0.42\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector. ^ Middle row is spaced 5.6\u00a0mm (0.22\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 21.3\u00a0mm (0.84\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. The connector is designed to withstand 10,000 mating cycles (a connection and a disconnection) and exposure to the elements. With 1 mating cycle per day, the connector's lifespan should exceed 27 years. [ 23 ] Release mechanism [ edit ] Black release button on an SAE J1772 plug in a mockup car SAE J1772 plugs operated by thumb at a VinFast charging station Adaptor cable from Nissan with Type 1 plug for the car, Type 2 plug for a European charger socket IEC 62196 Type 2 connector with openings on the side for automatic release The SAE J1772 or Type 1 plug is locked into the car with a hook that is manually operated, mostly by pressing a button with the thumb, which interrupts power. This allows anybody to stop charging and even theft of the cable. To prevent this, the European IEC 62196 Type 2 connector has openings on the side for automatic locking and release, operated by the car owner via remote control. If the car locks or releases its plug, the charger will follow suit according to the PP signal. In addition, the charge port on many modern cars with a J1772 connector have an extendable pin that blocks the J1772 latch from being raised. By extending this pin, it becomes impossible to raise the release latch. In this way, the vehicle can prevent a plugged-in J1772 connector from being removed. This is essential for the CCS implementation where the connector is not designed to break the heavy DC charging current. Charging [ edit ] The SAE J1772-2017 standard defines four levels of charging: AC Level 1 , AC Level 2 , DC Level 1 , and DC Level 2 . [ 24 ] Earlier released revisions of J1772 also listed a never-implemented AC Level 3 , which was considered but never implemented. Charge method Voltage (V) Phase Max. current, continuous (A) Branch circuit breaker rating (A) [ a ] Max. power (kW) AC Level 1 120 1 12 15 1.44 16 20 1.92 AC Level 2 208 or 240 1 24\u201380 30\u2013100 5.0\u201319.2 AC Level 3 [ b ] 208\u2013600 3 63\u2013160 80-200 22.7\u2013166 Charge method Voltage (V) Phase Max. current (A) Max. power (kW) DC Level 1 50\u20131000 \u2013 80 80 DC Level 2 50\u20131000 \u2013 400 400 ^ Per NEC article 625.41, branch circuit rating must be at least 125% of EVSE maximum continuous current ^ As noted in Appendix M of the SAE J1772 standard document, a third AC charge method was considered but never implemented for light vehicles. For heavy and industrial vehicles, this was left to the SAE J3068 Medium and Heavy Duty Vehicle Conductive Charging Task Force Committee which permits the J1772 protocol at 400 VAC or less and requires a newer LIN protocol above 400 VAC (LIN is recommended at all voltages).  J3068 uses the Type 2 ( Mennekes connector ) possibly supplying up to 166\u00a0kW. [ 25 ] The J1772 AC Level 3 mode using single phase power would have provided up to 96\u00a0kW at a nominal voltage of 240 V AC and a maximum current of 400 A.  This power level is closer to what J3068 implemented a decade later at up to 600 VAC, although J3068 version 1 only supports up to 250 amps. For example, the 2020 Chevrolet Bolt has a 66-kWh lithium-ion battery and a 7.2-kW onboard charging module; with an EPA range of 259 miles (417\u00a0km) and energy efficiency of 118\u00a0mpg\u2011e (29\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0mi; 17.7\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0km), [ 26 ] it can use its portable charge cord to charge at AC Level 1 (120 V, 12 A) to get up to 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) of range per hour or go off an AC Level 2 charging unit (240 V, 32 A) to get up to 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) of range per hour. Using an optional DC fast charging (DCFC) port, this model can also charge at up to 55 kW to get up to 180\u00a0mi (290\u00a0km) of range per hour. Other EVs utilizing an 800\u00a0V battery architecture (such as those on Hyundai's E-GMP platform) can charge much faster. According to Hyundai, \"With a 350 kW DC charger, IONIQ 5 can charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. According to WLTP cycle, IONIQ 5 users only need to charge the vehicle for five minutes to get 100 km of range.\" [ 27 ] These vehicles are capable of accepting up to 230kW until about 50% State of charge , allowing these vehicles to recharge much quicker than similar EVs with lower voltage batteries. Some EVs have extended J1772 to allow AC Level 1 (120 V) charging at greater than 16 amps. This is useful, for example, at RV parks where TT-30 (\"Travel Trailer\" - 120 V, 30 A) receptacles are common. These allow charging at up to 24 amps. However, this level of 120 V charging has not been codified into J1772. Another extension, supported by the North American Charging System , is Level 2 charging at 277 V.  Like 208 V, 277 V is commonly found in North American commercial three-phase circuits. Safety [ edit ] The J1772 standard includes several levels of shock protection, ensuring the safety of charging even in wet conditions.  Physically, the connection pins are isolated on the interior of the connector when mated, ensuring no physical access to those pins.  When not mated, J1772 connectors have no power at the pins; [ 28 ] they are not energized until commanded by the vehicle. [ 29 ] The proximity detection pin is connected to a switch in the connector release button. Pressing the release button causes the vehicle to stop drawing current. As the connector is removed, the shorter control pilot pin disconnects first, causing the EVSE to drop power to the plug. This also ensures that the power pins will not be disconnected under load, causing arcs and shortening their life. The ground pin is longer than the other pins, so it breaks last. Signaling [ edit ] J1772 signaling circuit The signaling protocol has been designed for the following charging sequence. [ 29 ] supply equipment signals presence of AC input power vehicle detects plug via proximity circuit (thus the vehicle can prevent driving away while connected) and can detect when latch is pressed in preparation for plug removal. Control Pilot (CP) functions begin supply equipment detects plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) supply equipment indicates to PEV readiness to supply current PEV ventilation requirements are determined supply equipment current capacity provided to PEV PEV commands energy flow PEV and supply equipment continuously monitor continuity of safety ground charge continues as determined by PEV charge may be interrupted by disconnecting the plug from the vehicle The technical specification was described first in the 2001 version of SAE J1772 and subsequently the IEC 61851 -1 and IEC TS 62763:2013. The charging station puts 12\u00a0V on the Control Pilot (CP) and the Proximity Pilot (AKA Plug Present: PP) measuring the voltage differences. This protocol does not require integrated circuits, which would be required for other charging protocols, making the SAE J1772 robust and operable through a temperature range of \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to +85\u00a0\u00b0C. Control Pilot [ edit ] Control Pilot (Mode) : The charging station sends a 1\u00a0kHz square wave on the control pilot that is connected back to the protective earth on the vehicle side by means of a resistor and a diode (voltage range \u00b112.0\u00b10.4\u00a0V). The live wires of public charging stations are always dead if the CP\u2013PE ( Protective Earth ) circuit is open, although the standard allows a charging current as in Mode 1 (maximum 16\u00a0A). If the circuit is closed, the charging station can also verify that the protective earth is functional. The vehicle can request a certain charging function by setting the resistance between the CP and PE pins; 2.7\u00a0k\u03a9 announces a Mode 3 compatible vehicle ( vehicle detected ) which does not require charging. 880\u00a0\u03a9 says the vehicle is ready to be charged, and 240\u00a0\u03a9 requests with ventilation charging, in which case the charging stations supplies charging power only if the area is ventilated (i.e., outdoors). The Control Pilot line circuitry examples in SAE J1772:2001 show that the current loop CP\u2013PE is connected permanently on the vehicle side via a 2.74\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor, making for a voltage drop from +12\u00a0V to +9\u00a0V when a cable is hooked up to the charging station, which activates the wave generator. The charging is activated by the vehicle by adding parallel 1.3\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor resulting in a voltage drop to +6\u00a0V or by adding a parallel 270\u00a0\u03a9 resistor for a required ventilation resulting in a voltage drop to +3\u00a0V. Hence the charging station can react by only checking the voltage range present on the CP\u2013PE loop. [ 30 ] Note that the diode will only make for a voltage drop in the positive range; any negative voltage on the CP\u2013PE loop is blocked by D1 in the vehicle, any significant current that does flow in the CP\u2013PE loop during the negative period will shut off the current as being considered a fatal error (like touching the pins). For IEC62196-2 male plugs the Control Pilot pin is made shorter to prevent untethered cables being used as \"extension leads\", This prevents the use of downstream cables that may have a lower current capability being connected to a cable of a higher current rating.

[ 31 ] The PWM duty cycle of the 1\u00a0kHz CP signal indicates the maximum allowed mains current. According to the SAE it includes socket outlet, cable and vehicle inlet. In the US, the definition of the ampacity (ampere capacity, or current capacity) is split for continuous and short term operation. [ 31 ] The SAE defines the ampacity value to be derived by a formula based on the 1\u00a0ms full cycle (of the 1\u00a0kHz signal) with the maximum continuous ampere rating being 0.6\u00a0A per 10\u00a0\u03bcs up to 850\u00a0\u03bcs (with the lowest (100\u00a0\u03bcs/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 0.6\u00a0A = 6\u00a0A).  Above 850\u00a0\u03bcs, the formula requires subtraction of 640\u00a0\u03bcs and multiplying the difference by 2.5.  For example ((960\u00a0\u03bcs \u2212 640\u00a0\u03bcs)/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 2.5\u00a0A = 80\u00a0A.

During charging, the EVSE side connects the PP\u2013PE loop via S3 and a 150\u00a0\u03a9 R6; when opening the release actuator a 330\u00a0\u03a9 R7 is added in the PP\u2013PE loop on the EVSE side which gives a voltage shift on the line to allow the electric vehicle to initiate a controlled shut off prior to actual disconnection of the charge power pins. However, many low-power adapter cables do not offer that locking actuator state detection on the PP pin. Under IEC 62196 the Proximity Pin is also used to indicate the cable capacity \u2013 this is relevant for non-tethered EVSEs. The resistor is coded to the maximum current capability of the cable assembly. The EV interrupts the current supply if the current capability of the cable is exceeded as detected by the measurement of the Rc (shown as R6 in the J1772 signaling circuit above), as defined by the values for the recommended interpretation range. Rc is placed between the PP and PE, within the detachable cable assembly. Current capability of the cable assembly Rc (\u00b13%) Recommended interpretation range by the EVSE 13 A 1.5 k\u03a9 / 0.5 W 1\u20132.7 k\u03a9 20 A 680 \u03a9 / 0.5 W 330 \u03a9 \u2013 1 k\u03a9 32 A 220 \u03a9 / 1 W 150\u2013330 \u03a9 70 A single-phase / 63 A three-phase 100 \u03a9 / 1 W 50\u2013150 \u03a9 [ 32 ] P1901 powerline communication [ edit ] In an updated standard due in 2012, SAE proposes to use power line communication , specifically IEEE 1901 , between the vehicle, off-board charging station , and the smart grid , without requiring an additional pin; SAE and the IEEE Standards Association are sharing their draft standards related to the smart grid and vehicle electrification. [ 33 ] P1901 communication is compatible with other 802.x standards via the IEEE 1905 standard, allowing arbitrary IP-based communications with the vehicle, meter or distributor, and the building where chargers are located.  P1905 includes wireless communications. In at least one implementation, communication between the off-board DC EVSE and PEV occurs on the pilot wire of the SAE J1772 connector via HomePlug Green PHY power line communication (PLC). [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Competing standards [ edit ] A competing proposal known as the Mennekes connector initiated by RWE and Daimler was standardized in 2011's IEC 62196 as its Type 2 connector. It has been widely adopted as the European Union's standard single- and three-phase coupler. [ 12 ] [ 37 ] The connector adopted the same protocols for the pilot pin as J1772's J-Plug. The IEC specification allows for up to 63\u00a0A and 43.6\u00a0kW.  In 2018, the SAE J3068 committee released an enhancement to the EU connector tailored for the North American industrial market allowing up to 160\u00a0A / 166\u00a0kW on 3\u03c6 power . The same IEC\u00a062196-2 standard also specified a pair of Type 3 connector from Scame Global providing a single- and three-phase coupler with shutters. [ 12 ] After a 2016 approval by the IEC for a small modification to the Mennekes connector optionally allowing shutters, Type 3 has been deprecated. Tokyo Electric Power Company has developed a specification solely for automotive high-voltage DC fast charging using the JARI DC connector and formed the CHAdeMO ( charge de move , equivalent to \"charge for moving\") association with Japanese automakers Mitsubishi , Nissan and Subaru to promote it.

SAE J1772 , also known as a J plug or Type 1 connector after its international standard, IEC 62196 Type 1, is a North American standard for electrical connectors for electric vehicles maintained by SAE International under the formal title \"SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice J1772, SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler\". [ 1 ] The SAE maintains the general physical, electrical, communication protocol, and performance requirements for the electric vehicle conductive charge system and coupler. The intent is to define a common electric vehicle conductive charging system architecture including operational requirements and the functional and dimensional requirements for the vehicle inlet and mating connector. The J1772 5-pin standard supports a wide range of single-phase (1\u03c6) alternating current (AC) charging rates. They range from portable devices that can connect to a household NEMA 5-15 outlet that can deliver 1.44\u00a0kW (12\u00a0A @ 120\u00a0V) to hardwired equipment that can deliver up to 19.2\u00a0kW (80\u00a0A @ 240\u00a0V). [ 2 ] These connectors are sometimes informally referred to as chargers, but they are \" electric vehicle supply equipment \" (EVSE), since they only supply AC power to the vehicle's on-board charger, which then converts it to the direct current (DC) needed to recharge the battery. The Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 1 connector builds on the standard, adding two additional pins for DC fast charging up to 350\u00a0kW. History [ edit ] The older Avcon connector, featured here on a Ford Ranger EV The main stimulus for the development of SAE J1772 came from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Early electric vehicles like the General Motors EV1 and Toyota RAV4 EV used Magne Charge (SAE J1773), an inductive system. CARB rejected the inductive technology in favor of conductive coupling to supply electricity for recharging. In June 2001, CARB adopted the SAE J1772-2001 standard as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] This early version of the connector was made by Avcon and featured a rectangular connector capable of delivering up to 6.6\u00a0kW of electrical power. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The California regulations mandated the usage of SAE J1772-2001 beginning with the 2006 model year. CARB would later ask for higher current delivery than the 6.6\u00a0kW that the 2001 J1772 (Avcon) standard supported. This process led to the proposal of a new round connector design by Yazaki which allowed for an increased power delivery of up to 19.2\u00a0kW delivered via single phase 120\u2013240 V AC at up to 80 amps. In 2008, CARB published a new standard that mandated the usage of the new connector beginning with the 2010 model year; [ 7 ] this was approved in 2012. [ 8 ] The Yazaki plug that was built to the new SAE J1772 plug standard successfully completed certification at UL . The standard specification was subsequently voted upon by the SAE committee in July 2009. [ 9 ] On January 14, 2010, the SAE J1772 REV 2009 was adopted by the SAE Motor Vehicle Council. [ 10 ] The companies participating in or supporting the revised 2009 standard include smart , Chrysler , GM , Ford , Toyota , Honda , Nissan , Rivian , and Tesla . The SAE J1772-2009 connector specification was subsequently added to the international IEC 62196-2 standard (\u201cPart 2: Dimensional compatibility and interchangeability requirements for a.c. pin and contact-tube accessories\u201d) with voting on the final specification slated to close in May 2011. [ 11 ] [ needs update ] The SAE J1772 connector is considered a \u201cType 1\u201d implementation providing a single phase coupler. [ 12 ] Vehicle equipment [ edit ] The SAE J1772-2009 was adopted by electric vehicle manufacturers in the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf . The connector became standard equipment in the U.S. market due to the availability of charging stations supporting it in the nation's electric vehicle network (helped by funding such as the ChargePoint America program drawing grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act). [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The European versions were equipped with a SAE J1772-2009 inlet as well until the automotive industry settled on the IEC Type 2 \u201cMennekes\u201d connector as the standard inlet\u00a0\u2013 since all IEC connectors use the same SAE J1772 signaling protocol the car manufacturers are selling cars with either a SAE J1772-2009 inlet or an IEC Type 2 inlet depending on the regional market. There are also (passive) adapters available that can convert J1772-2009 to IEC Type 2 and vice versa. The only difference is that most European versions have an on-board charger that can take advantage of three-phase electric power with higher voltage and current limits even for the same basic electric vehicle model (such as the Chevrolet Volt/Opel Ampera ). [ citation needed ] Combined Charging System (CCS) [ edit ] Main article: Combined Charging System CCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins In 2011, SAE developed a J1772/CCS Combo Coupler variant of the J1772-2009 connector in order to also support the Combined Charging System standard for direct current (DC) fast charging, which includes the standard 5-pin J1772 connector along with an additional two larger pins to support fast DC charging. Combo 1 accommodates charging at 200\u2013920 volts DC and up to 350\u00a0kW. [1] [ needs update ] The combination coupler will also use power-line communication technology to communicate between the vehicle, off-board charger, and smart grid. [ 15 ] Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Porsche, Volvo, and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce the Combined Charging System in mid-2012. [ 16 ] The first vehicles using the SAE Combo plug were the BMW i3 released in late 2013, and the Chevrolet Spark EV released in 2014. [ 17 ] In Europe, the combo coupler is based on the Type 2 (VDE) AC charging connector (Combo 2) maintaining full compatibility with the SAE specification for DC charging and the HomePlug Green PHY PLC protocol. [ 18 ] In 2019 Tesla introduced the Model 3 with a CCS Combo 2 plug in Europe, but has not introduced models with CCS in the US. With the introduction of the Model 3 in Europe, Tesla added CCS charging cables to V2 Superchargers (supporting both CCS Combo 2 and Tesla DC Type 2). European V3 Tesla Superchargers include only a CCS charging cable. [ 19 ] Properties [ edit ] Connector [ edit ] The J1772-2009 connector is designed for single phase alternating current electrical systems with 120\u00a0V or 240\u00a0V such as those used in North America and Japan. The round 43-millimetre (1.7\u00a0in) diameter connector is keyed and has five pins (viewed from outside of the plug): [ 20 ] SAE J1772 / IEC 62196-2-1 Type 1 Row Position Function Notes Top [ a ] 1 L1 \"AC Line 1\" 2 N \"AC Neutral\" for 120 V Level 1 charging or \"AC Line 2\" for 208\u2013240 V Level 2 charging Bottom [ b ] 3 PE \"Protective Earth\" aka Ground Middle [ c ] 4 PP \"Proximity Pilot\" aka \"plug present\", which provides a signal to the vehicle's control system so it can prevent movement while connected to the electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ; i.e., the charging station), and signals the latch release button to the vehicle. [ citation needed ] 5 CP \"Control Pilot\" is a communication line used to negotiate charging level between the car and the EVSE, and it can be manipulated by the vehicle to initiate charging and can carry other information. [ 21 ] The signal is a 1\u00a0kHz square wave at \u00b112 volts generated by the EVSE to detect the presence of the vehicle, communicate the maximum allowable charging current, and control charging begin/end. [ 22 ] ^ Top row is spaced 6.8\u00a0mm (0.27\u00a0in) above the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 15.7\u00a0mm (0.62\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. ^ Bottom row is spaced 10.6\u00a0mm (0.42\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector. ^ Middle row is spaced 5.6\u00a0mm (0.22\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 21.3\u00a0mm (0.84\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. The connector is designed to withstand 10,000 mating cycles (a connection and a disconnection) and exposure to the elements. With 1 mating cycle per day, the connector's lifespan should exceed 27 years. [ 23 ] Release mechanism [ edit ] Black release button on an SAE J1772 plug in a mockup car SAE J1772 plugs operated by thumb at a VinFast charging station Adaptor cable from Nissan with Type 1 plug for the car, Type 2 plug for a European charger socket IEC 62196 Type 2 connector with openings on the side for automatic release The SAE J1772 or Type 1 plug is locked into the car with a hook that is manually operated, mostly by pressing a button with the thumb, which interrupts power. This allows anybody to stop charging and even theft of the cable. To prevent this, the European IEC 62196 Type 2 connector has openings on the side for automatic locking and release, operated by the car owner via remote control. If the car locks or releases its plug, the charger will follow suit according to the PP signal. In addition, the charge port on many modern cars with a J1772 connector have an extendable pin that blocks the J1772 latch from being raised. By extending this pin, it becomes impossible to raise the release latch. In this way, the vehicle can prevent a plugged-in J1772 connector from being removed. This is essential for the CCS implementation where the connector is not designed to break the heavy DC charging current. Charging [ edit ] The SAE J1772-2017 standard defines four levels of charging: AC Level 1 , AC Level 2 , DC Level 1 , and DC Level 2 . [ 24 ] Earlier released revisions of J1772 also listed a never-implemented AC Level 3 , which was considered but never implemented. Charge method Voltage (V) Phase Max. current, continuous (A) Branch circuit breaker rating (A) [ a ] Max. power (kW) AC Level 1 120 1 12 15 1.44 16 20 1.92 AC Level 2 208 or 240 1 24\u201380 30\u2013100 5.0\u201319.2 AC Level 3 [ b ] 208\u2013600 3 63\u2013160 80-200 22.7\u2013166 Charge method Voltage (V) Phase Max. current (A) Max. power (kW) DC Level 1 50\u20131000 \u2013 80 80 DC Level 2 50\u20131000 \u2013 400 400 ^ Per NEC article 625.41, branch circuit rating must be at least 125% of EVSE maximum continuous current ^ As noted in Appendix M of the SAE J1772 standard document, a third AC charge method was considered but never implemented for light vehicles. For heavy and industrial vehicles, this was left to the SAE J3068 Medium and Heavy Duty Vehicle Conductive Charging Task Force Committee which permits the J1772 protocol at 400 VAC or less and requires a newer LIN protocol above 400 VAC (LIN is recommended at all voltages).  J3068 uses the Type 2 ( Mennekes connector ) possibly supplying up to 166\u00a0kW. [ 25 ] The J1772 AC Level 3 mode using single phase power would have provided up to 96\u00a0kW at a nominal voltage of 240 V AC and a maximum current of 400 A.  This power level is closer to what J3068 implemented a decade later at up to 600 VAC, although J3068 version 1 only supports up to 250 amps. For example, the 2020 Chevrolet Bolt has a 66-kWh lithium-ion battery and a 7.2-kW onboard charging module; with an EPA range of 259 miles (417\u00a0km) and energy efficiency of 118\u00a0mpg\u2011e (29\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0mi; 17.7\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0km), [ 26 ] it can use its portable charge cord to charge at AC Level 1 (120 V, 12 A) to get up to 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) of range per hour or go off an AC Level 2 charging unit (240 V, 32 A) to get up to 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) of range per hour. Using an optional DC fast charging (DCFC) port, this model can also charge at up to 55 kW to get up to 180\u00a0mi (290\u00a0km) of range per hour. Other EVs utilizing an 800\u00a0V battery architecture (such as those on Hyundai's E-GMP platform) can charge much faster. According to Hyundai, \"With a 350 kW DC charger, IONIQ 5 can charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. According to WLTP cycle, IONIQ 5 users only need to charge the vehicle for five minutes to get 100 km of range.\" [ 27 ] These vehicles are capable of accepting up to 230kW until about 50% State of charge , allowing these vehicles to recharge much quicker than similar EVs with lower voltage batteries. Some EVs have extended J1772 to allow AC Level 1 (120 V) charging at greater than 16 amps. This is useful, for example, at RV parks where TT-30 (\"Travel Trailer\" - 120 V, 30 A) receptacles are common. These allow charging at up to 24 amps. However, this level of 120 V charging has not been codified into J1772. Another extension, supported by the North American Charging System , is Level 2 charging at 277 V.  Like 208 V, 277 V is commonly found in North American commercial three-phase circuits. Safety [ edit ] The J1772 standard includes several levels of shock protection, ensuring the safety of charging even in wet conditions.  Physically, the connection pins are isolated on the interior of the connector when mated, ensuring no physical access to those pins.  When not mated, J1772 connectors have no power at the pins; [ 28 ] they are not energized until commanded by the vehicle. [ 29 ] The proximity detection pin is connected to a switch in the connector release button. Pressing the release button causes the vehicle to stop drawing current. As the connector is removed, the shorter control pilot pin disconnects first, causing the EVSE to drop power to the plug. This also ensures that the power pins will not be disconnected under load, causing arcs and shortening their life. The ground pin is longer than the other pins, so it breaks last. Signaling [ edit ] J1772 signaling circuit The signaling protocol has been designed for the following charging sequence. [ 29 ] supply equipment signals presence of AC input power vehicle detects plug via proximity circuit (thus the vehicle can prevent driving away while connected) and can detect when latch is pressed in preparation for plug removal. Control Pilot (CP) functions begin supply equipment detects plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) supply equipment indicates to PEV readiness to supply current PEV ventilation requirements are determined supply equipment current capacity provided to PEV PEV commands energy flow PEV and supply equipment continuously monitor continuity of safety ground charge continues as determined by PEV charge may be interrupted by disconnecting the plug from the vehicle The technical specification was described first in the 2001 version of SAE J1772 and subsequently the IEC 61851 -1 and IEC TS 62763:2013. The charging station puts 12\u00a0V on the Control Pilot (CP) and the Proximity Pilot (AKA Plug Present: PP) measuring the voltage differences. This protocol does not require integrated circuits, which would be required for other charging protocols, making the SAE J1772 robust and operable through a temperature range of \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to +85\u00a0\u00b0C. Control Pilot [ edit ] Control Pilot (Mode) : The charging station sends a 1\u00a0kHz square wave on the control pilot that is connected back to the protective earth on the vehicle side by means of a resistor and a diode (voltage range \u00b112.0\u00b10.4\u00a0V). The live wires of public charging stations are always dead if the CP\u2013PE ( Protective Earth ) circuit is open, although the standard allows a charging current as in Mode 1 (maximum 16\u00a0A). If the circuit is closed, the charging station can also verify that the protective earth is functional. The vehicle can request a certain charging function by setting the resistance between the CP and PE pins; 2.7\u00a0k\u03a9 announces a Mode 3 compatible vehicle ( vehicle detected ) which does not require charging. 880\u00a0\u03a9 says the vehicle is ready to be charged, and 240\u00a0\u03a9 requests with ventilation charging, in which case the charging stations supplies charging power only if the area is ventilated (i.e., outdoors). The Control Pilot line circuitry examples in SAE J1772:2001 show that the current loop CP\u2013PE is connected permanently on the vehicle side via a 2.74\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor, making for a voltage drop from +12\u00a0V to +9\u00a0V when a cable is hooked up to the charging station, which activates the wave generator. The charging is activated by the vehicle by adding parallel 1.3\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor resulting in a voltage drop to +6\u00a0V or by adding a parallel 270\u00a0\u03a9 resistor for a required ventilation resulting in a voltage drop to +3\u00a0V. Hence the charging station can react by only checking the voltage range present on the CP\u2013PE loop. [ 30 ] Note that the diode will only make for a voltage drop in the positive range; any negative voltage on the CP\u2013PE loop is blocked by D1 in the vehicle, any significant current that does flow in the CP\u2013PE loop during the negative period will shut off the current as being considered a fatal error (like touching the pins). For IEC62196-2 male plugs the Control Pilot pin is made shorter to prevent untethered cables being used as \"extension leads\", This prevents the use of downstream cables that may have a lower current capability being connected to a cable of a higher current rating.

[ 31 ] The PWM duty cycle of the 1\u00a0kHz CP signal indicates the maximum allowed mains current. According to the SAE it includes socket outlet, cable and vehicle inlet. In the US, the definition of the ampacity (ampere capacity, or current capacity) is split for continuous and short term operation. [ 31 ] The SAE defines the ampacity value to be derived by a formula based on the 1\u00a0ms full cycle (of the 1\u00a0kHz signal) with the maximum continuous ampere rating being 0.6\u00a0A per 10\u00a0\u03bcs up to 850\u00a0\u03bcs (with the lowest (100\u00a0\u03bcs/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 0.6\u00a0A = 6\u00a0A).  Above 850\u00a0\u03bcs, the formula requires subtraction of 640\u00a0\u03bcs and multiplying the difference by 2.5.  For example ((960\u00a0\u03bcs \u2212 640\u00a0\u03bcs)/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 2.5\u00a0A = 80\u00a0A.

During charging, the EVSE side connects the PP\u2013PE loop via S3 and a 150\u00a0\u03a9 R6; when opening the release actuator a 330\u00a0\u03a9 R7 is added in the PP\u2013PE loop on the EVSE side which gives a voltage shift on the line to allow the electric vehicle to initiate a controlled shut off prior to actual disconnection of the charge power pins. However, many low-power adapter cables do not offer that locking actuator state detection on the PP pin. Under IEC 62196 the Proximity Pin is also used to indicate the cable capacity \u2013 this is relevant for non-tethered EVSEs. The resistor is coded to the maximum current capability of the cable assembly. The EV interrupts the current supply if the current capability of the cable is exceeded as detected by the measurement of the Rc (shown as R6 in the J1772 signaling circuit above), as defined by the values for the recommended interpretation range. Rc is placed between the PP and PE, within the detachable cable assembly.

[ 33 ] P1901 communication is compatible with other 802.x standards via the IEEE 1905 standard, allowing arbitrary IP-based communications with the vehicle, meter or distributor, and the building where chargers are located.  P1905 includes wireless communications. In at least one implementation, communication between the off-board DC EVSE and PEV occurs on the pilot wire of the SAE J1772 connector via HomePlug Green PHY power line communication (PLC). [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Competing standards [ edit ] A competing proposal known as the Mennekes connector initiated by RWE and Daimler was standardized in 2011's IEC 62196 as its Type 2 connector. It has been widely adopted as the European Union's standard single- and three-phase coupler. [ 12 ] [ 37 ] The connector adopted the same protocols for the pilot pin as J1772's J-Plug. The IEC specification allows for up to 63\u00a0A and 43.6\u00a0kW.  In 2018, the SAE J3068 committee released an enhancement to the EU connector tailored for the North American industrial market allowing up to 160\u00a0A / 166\u00a0kW on 3\u03c6 power . The same IEC\u00a062196-2 standard also specified a pair of Type 3 connector from Scame Global providing a single- and three-phase coupler with shutters. [ 12 ] After a 2016 approval by the IEC for a small modification to the Mennekes connector optionally allowing shutters, Type 3 has been deprecated. Tokyo Electric Power Company has developed a specification solely for automotive high-voltage DC fast charging using the JARI DC connector and formed the CHAdeMO ( charge de move , equivalent to \"charge for moving\") association with Japanese automakers Mitsubishi , Nissan and Subaru to promote it.

underneath, and the two Alternating Current (AC) pins for Neutral and Line 1 are not populated. SAE J1772 , also known as a J plug or Type 1 connector after its international standard, IEC 62196 Type 1, is a North American standard for electrical connectors for electric vehicles maintained by SAE International under the formal title \"SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice J1772, SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler\". [ 1 ] The SAE maintains the general physical, electrical, communication protocol, and performance requirements for the electric vehicle conductive charge system and coupler. The intent is to define a common electric vehicle conductive charging system architecture including operational requirements and the functional and dimensional requirements for the vehicle inlet and mating connector. The J1772 5-pin standard supports a wide range of single-phase (1\u03c6) alternating current (AC) charging rates. They range from portable devices that can connect to a household NEMA 5-15 outlet that can deliver 1.44\u00a0kW (12\u00a0A @ 120\u00a0V) to hardwired equipment that can deliver up to 19.2\u00a0kW (80\u00a0A @ 240\u00a0V). [ 2 ] These connectors are sometimes informally referred to as chargers, but they are \" electric vehicle supply equipment \" (EVSE), since they only supply AC power to the vehicle's on-board charger, which then converts it to the direct current (DC) needed to recharge the battery. The Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 1 connector builds on the standard, adding two additional pins for DC fast charging up to 350\u00a0kW. History [ edit ] The older Avcon connector, featured here on a Ford Ranger EV The main stimulus for the development of SAE J1772 came from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Early electric vehicles like the General Motors EV1 and Toyota RAV4 EV used Magne Charge (SAE J1773), an inductive system. CARB rejected the inductive technology in favor of conductive coupling to supply electricity for recharging. In June 2001, CARB adopted the SAE J1772-2001 standard as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] This early version of the connector was made by Avcon and featured a rectangular connector capable of delivering up to 6.6\u00a0kW of electrical power. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The California regulations mandated the usage of SAE J1772-2001 beginning with the 2006 model year. CARB would later ask for higher current delivery than the 6.6\u00a0kW that the 2001 J1772 (Avcon) standard supported. This process led to the proposal of a new round connector design by Yazaki which allowed for an increased power delivery of up to 19.2\u00a0kW delivered via single phase 120\u2013240 V AC at up to 80 amps. In 2008, CARB published a new standard that mandated the usage of the new connector beginning with the 2010 model year; [ 7 ] this was approved in 2012. [ 8 ] The Yazaki plug that was built to the new SAE J1772 plug standard successfully completed certification at UL . The standard specification was subsequently voted upon by the SAE committee in July 2009. [ 9 ] On January 14, 2010, the SAE J1772 REV 2009 was adopted by the SAE Motor Vehicle Council. [ 10 ] The companies participating in or supporting the revised 2009 standard include smart , Chrysler , GM , Ford , Toyota , Honda , Nissan , Rivian , and Tesla . The SAE J1772-2009 connector specification was subsequently added to the international IEC 62196-2 standard (\u201cPart 2: Dimensional compatibility and interchangeability requirements for a.c. pin and contact-tube accessories\u201d) with voting on the final specification slated to close in May 2011. [ 11 ] [ needs update ] The SAE J1772 connector is considered a \u201cType 1\u201d implementation providing a single phase coupler. [ 12 ] Vehicle equipment [ edit ] The SAE J1772-2009 was adopted by electric vehicle manufacturers in the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf . The connector became standard equipment in the U.S. market due to the availability of charging stations supporting it in the nation's electric vehicle network (helped by funding such as the ChargePoint America program drawing grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act). [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The European versions were equipped with a SAE J1772-2009 inlet as well until the automotive industry settled on the IEC Type 2 \u201cMennekes\u201d connector as the standard inlet\u00a0\u2013 since all IEC connectors use the same SAE J1772 signaling protocol the car manufacturers are selling cars with either a SAE J1772-2009 inlet or an IEC Type 2 inlet depending on the regional market. There are also (passive) adapters available that can convert J1772-2009 to IEC Type 2 and vice versa. The only difference is that most European versions have an on-board charger that can take advantage of three-phase electric power with higher voltage and current limits even for the same basic electric vehicle model (such as the Chevrolet Volt/Opel Ampera ). [ citation needed ] Combined Charging System (CCS) [ edit ] Main article: Combined Charging System CCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins In 2011, SAE developed a J1772/CCS Combo Coupler variant of the J1772-2009 connector in order to also support the Combined Charging System standard for direct current (DC) fast charging, which includes the standard 5-pin J1772 connector along with an additional two larger pins to support fast DC charging. Combo 1 accommodates charging at 200\u2013920 volts DC and up to 350\u00a0kW. [1] [ needs update ] The combination coupler will also use power-line communication technology to communicate between the vehicle, off-board charger, and smart grid. [ 15 ] Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Porsche, Volvo, and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce the Combined Charging System in mid-2012. [ 16 ] The first vehicles using the SAE Combo plug were the BMW i3 released in late 2013, and the Chevrolet Spark EV released in 2014. [ 17 ] In Europe, the combo coupler is based on the Type 2 (VDE) AC charging connector (Combo 2) maintaining full compatibility with the SAE specification for DC charging and the HomePlug Green PHY PLC protocol. [ 18 ] In 2019 Tesla introduced the Model 3 with a CCS Combo 2 plug in Europe, but has not introduced models with CCS in the US. With the introduction of the Model 3 in Europe, Tesla added CCS charging cables to V2 Superchargers (supporting both CCS Combo 2 and Tesla DC Type 2). European V3 Tesla Superchargers include only a CCS charging cable. [ 19 ] Properties [ edit ] Connector [ edit ] The J1772-2009 connector is designed for single phase alternating current electrical systems with 120\u00a0V or 240\u00a0V such as those used in North America and Japan. The round 43-millimetre (1.7\u00a0in) diameter connector is keyed and has five pins (viewed from outside of the plug): [ 20 ] SAE J1772 / IEC 62196-2-1 Type 1 Row Position Function Notes Top [ a ] 1 L1 \"AC Line 1\" 2 N \"AC Neutral\" for 120 V Level 1 charging or \"AC Line 2\" for 208\u2013240 V Level 2 charging Bottom [ b ] 3 PE \"Protective Earth\" aka Ground Middle [ c ] 4 PP \"Proximity Pilot\" aka \"plug present\", which provides a signal to the vehicle's control system so it can prevent movement while connected to the electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ; i.e., the charging station), and signals the latch release button to the vehicle. [ citation needed ] 5 CP \"Control Pilot\" is a communication line used to negotiate charging level between the car and the EVSE, and it can be manipulated by the vehicle to initiate charging and can carry other information. [ 21 ] The signal is a 1\u00a0kHz square wave at \u00b112 volts generated by the EVSE to detect the presence of the vehicle, communicate the maximum allowable charging current, and control charging begin/end. [ 22 ] ^ Top row is spaced 6.8\u00a0mm (0.27\u00a0in) above the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 15.7\u00a0mm (0.62\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. ^ Bottom row is spaced 10.6\u00a0mm (0.42\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector. ^ Middle row is spaced 5.6\u00a0mm (0.22\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 21.3\u00a0mm (0.84\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. The connector is designed to withstand 10,000 mating cycles (a connection and a disconnection) and exposure to the elements. With 1 mating cycle per day, the connector's lifespan should exceed 27 years. [ 23 ] Release mechanism [ edit ] Black release button on an SAE J1772 plug in a mockup car SAE J1772 plugs operated by thumb at a VinFast charging station Adaptor cable from Nissan with Type 1 plug for the car, Type 2 plug for a European charger socket IEC 62196 Type 2 connector with openings on the side for automatic release The SAE J1772 or Type 1 plug is locked into the car with a hook that is manually operated, mostly by pressing a button with the thumb, which interrupts power. This allows anybody to stop charging and even theft of the cable. To prevent this, the European IEC 62196 Type 2 connector has openings on the side for automatic locking and release, operated by the car owner via remote control. If the car locks or releases its plug, the charger will follow suit according to the PP signal. In addition, the charge port on many modern cars with a J1772 connector have an extendable pin that blocks the J1772 latch from being raised. By extending this pin, it becomes impossible to raise the release latch. In this way, the vehicle can prevent a plugged-in J1772 connector from being removed. This is essential for the CCS implementation where the connector is not designed to break the heavy DC charging current. Charging [ edit ] The SAE J1772-2017 standard defines four levels of charging: AC Level 1 , AC Level 2 , DC Level 1 , and DC Level 2 . [ 24 ] Earlier released revisions of J1772 also listed a never-implemented AC Level 3 , which was considered but never implemented. Charge method Voltage (V) Phase Max. current, continuous (A) Branch circuit breaker rating (A) [ a ] Max. power (kW) AC Level 1 120 1 12 15 1.44 16 20 1.92 AC Level 2 208 or 240 1 24\u201380 30\u2013100 5.0\u201319.2 AC Level 3 [ b ] 208\u2013600 3 63\u2013160 80-200 22.7\u2013166 Charge method Voltage (V) Phase Max. current (A) Max. power (kW) DC Level 1 50\u20131000 \u2013 80 80 DC Level 2 50\u20131000 \u2013 400 400 ^ Per NEC article 625.41, branch circuit rating must be at least 125% of EVSE maximum continuous current ^ As noted in Appendix M of the SAE J1772 standard document, a third AC charge method was considered but never implemented for light vehicles. For heavy and industrial vehicles, this was left to the SAE J3068 Medium and Heavy Duty Vehicle Conductive Charging Task Force Committee which permits the J1772 protocol at 400 VAC or less and requires a newer LIN protocol above 400 VAC (LIN is recommended at all voltages).  J3068 uses the Type 2 ( Mennekes connector ) possibly supplying up to 166\u00a0kW. [ 25 ] The J1772 AC Level 3 mode using single phase power would have provided up to 96\u00a0kW at a nominal voltage of 240 V AC and a maximum current of 400 A.  This power level is closer to what J3068 implemented a decade later at up to 600 VAC, although J3068 version 1 only supports up to 250 amps. For example, the 2020 Chevrolet Bolt has a 66-kWh lithium-ion battery and a 7.2-kW onboard charging module; with an EPA range of 259 miles (417\u00a0km) and energy efficiency of 118\u00a0mpg\u2011e (29\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0mi; 17.7\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0km), [ 26 ] it can use its portable charge cord to charge at AC Level 1 (120 V, 12 A) to get up to 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) of range per hour or go off an AC Level 2 charging unit (240 V, 32 A) to get up to 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) of range per hour. Using an optional DC fast charging (DCFC) port, this model can also charge at up to 55 kW to get up to 180\u00a0mi (290\u00a0km) of range per hour. Other EVs utilizing an 800\u00a0V battery architecture (such as those on Hyundai's E-GMP platform) can charge much faster. According to Hyundai, \"With a 350 kW DC charger, IONIQ 5 can charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. According to WLTP cycle, IONIQ 5 users only need to charge the vehicle for five minutes to get 100 km of range.\" [ 27 ] These vehicles are capable of accepting up to 230kW until about 50% State of charge , allowing these vehicles to recharge much quicker than similar EVs with lower voltage batteries. Some EVs have extended J1772 to allow AC Level 1 (120 V) charging at greater than 16 amps. This is useful, for example, at RV parks where TT-30 (\"Travel Trailer\" - 120 V, 30 A) receptacles are common. These allow charging at up to 24 amps. However, this level of 120 V charging has not been codified into J1772. Another extension, supported by the North American Charging System , is Level 2 charging at 277 V.  Like 208 V, 277 V is commonly found in North American commercial three-phase circuits. Safety [ edit ] The J1772 standard includes several levels of shock protection, ensuring the safety of charging even in wet conditions.  Physically, the connection pins are isolated on the interior of the connector when mated, ensuring no physical access to those pins.  When not mated, J1772 connectors have no power at the pins; [ 28 ] they are not energized until commanded by the vehicle. [ 29 ] The proximity detection pin is connected to a switch in the connector release button. Pressing the release button causes the vehicle to stop drawing current. As the connector is removed, the shorter control pilot pin disconnects first, causing the EVSE to drop power to the plug. This also ensures that the power pins will not be disconnected under load, causing arcs and shortening their life. The ground pin is longer than the other pins, so it breaks last. Signaling [ edit ] J1772 signaling circuit The signaling protocol has been designed for the following charging sequence. [ 29 ] supply equipment signals presence of AC input power vehicle detects plug via proximity circuit (thus the vehicle can prevent driving away while connected) and can detect when latch is pressed in preparation for plug removal. Control Pilot (CP) functions begin supply equipment detects plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) supply equipment indicates to PEV readiness to supply current PEV ventilation requirements are determined supply equipment current capacity provided to PEV PEV commands energy flow PEV and supply equipment continuously monitor continuity of safety ground charge continues as determined by PEV charge may be interrupted by disconnecting the plug from the vehicle The technical specification was described first in the 2001 version of SAE J1772 and subsequently the IEC 61851 -1 and IEC TS 62763:2013. The charging station puts 12\u00a0V on the Control Pilot (CP) and the Proximity Pilot (AKA Plug Present: PP) measuring the voltage differences. This protocol does not require integrated circuits, which would be required for other charging protocols, making the SAE J1772 robust and operable through a temperature range of \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to +85\u00a0\u00b0C. Control Pilot [ edit ] Control Pilot (Mode) : The charging station sends a 1\u00a0kHz square wave on the control pilot that is connected back to the protective earth on the vehicle side by means of a resistor and a diode (voltage range \u00b112.0\u00b10.4\u00a0V). The live wires of public charging stations are always dead if the CP\u2013PE ( Protective Earth ) circuit is open, although the standard allows a charging current as in Mode 1 (maximum 16\u00a0A). If the circuit is closed, the charging station can also verify that the protective earth is functional. The vehicle can request a certain charging function by setting the resistance between the CP and PE pins; 2.7\u00a0k\u03a9 announces a Mode 3 compatible vehicle ( vehicle detected ) which does not require charging. 880\u00a0\u03a9 says the vehicle is ready to be charged, and 240\u00a0\u03a9 requests with ventilation charging, in which case the charging stations supplies charging power only if the area is ventilated (i.e., outdoors). The Control Pilot line circuitry examples in SAE J1772:2001 show that the current loop CP\u2013PE is connected permanently on the vehicle side via a 2.74\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor, making for a voltage drop from +12\u00a0V to +9\u00a0V when a cable is hooked up to the charging station, which activates the wave generator. The charging is activated by the vehicle by adding parallel 1.3\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor resulting in a voltage drop to +6\u00a0V or by adding a parallel 270\u00a0\u03a9 resistor for a required ventilation resulting in a voltage drop to +3\u00a0V. Hence the charging station can react by only checking the voltage range present on the CP\u2013PE loop. [ 30 ] Note that the diode will only make for a voltage drop in the positive range; any negative voltage on the CP\u2013PE loop is blocked by D1 in the vehicle, any significant current that does flow in the CP\u2013PE loop during the negative period will shut off the current as being considered a fatal error (like touching the pins). For IEC62196-2 male plugs the Control Pilot pin is made shorter to prevent untethered cables being used as \"extension leads\", This prevents the use of downstream cables that may have a lower current capability being connected to a cable of a higher current rating.

[ 31 ] The PWM duty cycle of the 1\u00a0kHz CP signal indicates the maximum allowed mains current. According to the SAE it includes socket outlet, cable and vehicle inlet. In the US, the definition of the ampacity (ampere capacity, or current capacity) is split for continuous and short term operation. [ 31 ] The SAE defines the ampacity value to be derived by a formula based on the 1\u00a0ms full cycle (of the 1\u00a0kHz signal) with the maximum continuous ampere rating being 0.6\u00a0A per 10\u00a0\u03bcs up to 850\u00a0\u03bcs (with the lowest (100\u00a0\u03bcs/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 0.6\u00a0A = 6\u00a0A).  Above 850\u00a0\u03bcs, the formula requires subtraction of 640\u00a0\u03bcs and multiplying the difference by 2.5.  For example ((960\u00a0\u03bcs \u2212 640\u00a0\u03bcs)/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 2.5\u00a0A = 80\u00a0A.

During charging, the EVSE side connects the PP\u2013PE loop via S3 and a 150\u00a0\u03a9 R6; when opening the release actuator a 330\u00a0\u03a9 R7 is added in the PP\u2013PE loop on the EVSE side which gives a voltage shift on the line to allow the electric vehicle to initiate a controlled shut off prior to actual disconnection of the charge power pins. However, many low-power adapter cables do not offer that locking actuator state detection on the PP pin. Under IEC 62196 the Proximity Pin is also used to indicate the cable capacity \u2013 this is relevant for non-tethered EVSEs. The resistor is coded to the maximum current capability of the cable assembly. The EV interrupts the current supply if the current capability of the cable is exceeded as detected by the measurement of the Rc (shown as R6 in the J1772 signaling circuit above), as defined by the values for the recommended interpretation range. Rc is placed between the PP and PE, within the detachable cable assembly. Current capability of the cable assembly Rc (\u00b13%) Recommended interpretation range by the EVSE 13 A 1.5 k\u03a9 / 0.5 W 1\u20132.7 k\u03a9 20 A 680 \u03a9 / 0.5 W 330 \u03a9 \u2013 1 k\u03a9 32 A 220 \u03a9 / 1 W 150\u2013330 \u03a9 70 A single-phase / 63 A three-phase 100 \u03a9 / 1 W 50\u2013150 \u03a9 [ 32 ] P1901 powerline communication [ edit ] In an updated standard due in 2012, SAE proposes to use power line communication , specifically IEEE 1901 , between the vehicle, off-board charging station , and the smart grid , without requiring an additional pin; SAE and the IEEE Standards Association are sharing their draft standards related to the smart grid and vehicle electrification. [ 33 ] P1901 communication is compatible with other 802.x standards via the IEEE 1905 standard, allowing arbitrary IP-based communications with the vehicle, meter or distributor, and the building where chargers are located.  P1905 includes wireless communications. In at least one implementation, communication between the off-board DC EVSE and PEV occurs on the pilot wire of the SAE J1772 connector via HomePlug Green PHY power line communication (PLC). [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Competing standards [ edit ] A competing proposal known as the Mennekes connector initiated by RWE and Daimler was standardized in 2011's IEC 62196 as its Type 2 connector. It has been widely adopted as the European Union's standard single- and three-phase coupler. [ 12 ] [ 37 ] The connector adopted the same protocols for the pilot pin as J1772's J-Plug. The IEC specification allows for up to 63\u00a0A and 43.6\u00a0kW.  In 2018, the SAE J3068 committee released an enhancement to the EU connector tailored for the North American industrial market allowing up to 160\u00a0A / 166\u00a0kW on 3\u03c6 power . The same IEC\u00a062196-2 standard also specified a pair of Type 3 connector from Scame Global providing a single- and three-phase coupler with shutters. [ 12 ] After a 2016 approval by the IEC for a small modification to the Mennekes connector optionally allowing shutters, Type 3 has been deprecated. Tokyo Electric Power Company has developed a specification solely for automotive high-voltage DC fast charging using the JARI DC connector and formed the CHAdeMO ( charge de move , equivalent to \"charge for moving\") association with Japanese automakers Mitsubishi , Nissan and Subaru to promote it.

SAE J1772 , also known as a J plug or Type 1 connector after its international standard, IEC 62196 Type 1, is a North American standard for electrical connectors for electric vehicles maintained by SAE International under the formal title \"SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice J1772, SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler\". [ 1 ] The SAE maintains the general physical, electrical, communication protocol, and performance requirements for the electric vehicle conductive charge system and coupler. The intent is to define a common electric vehicle conductive charging system architecture including operational requirements and the functional and dimensional requirements for the vehicle inlet and mating connector. The J1772 5-pin standard supports a wide range of single-phase (1\u03c6) alternating current (AC) charging rates. They range from portable devices that can connect to a household NEMA 5-15 outlet that can deliver 1.44\u00a0kW (12\u00a0A @ 120\u00a0V) to hardwired equipment that can deliver up to 19.2\u00a0kW (80\u00a0A @ 240\u00a0V). [ 2 ] These connectors are sometimes informally referred to as chargers, but they are \" electric vehicle supply equipment \" (EVSE), since they only supply AC power to the vehicle's on-board charger, which then converts it to the direct current (DC) needed to recharge the battery. The Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 1 connector builds on the standard, adding two additional pins for DC fast charging up to 350\u00a0kW. History [ edit ] The older Avcon connector, featured here on a Ford Ranger EV The main stimulus for the development of SAE J1772 came from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Early electric vehicles like the General Motors EV1 and Toyota RAV4 EV used Magne Charge (SAE J1773), an inductive system. CARB rejected the inductive technology in favor of conductive coupling to supply electricity for recharging. In June 2001, CARB adopted the SAE J1772-2001 standard as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] This early version of the connector was made by Avcon and featured a rectangular connector capable of delivering up to 6.6\u00a0kW of electrical power. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The California regulations mandated the usage of SAE J1772-2001 beginning with the 2006 model year. CARB would later ask for higher current delivery than the 6.6\u00a0kW that the 2001 J1772 (Avcon) standard supported. This process led to the proposal of a new round connector design by Yazaki which allowed for an increased power delivery of up to 19.2\u00a0kW delivered via single phase 120\u2013240 V AC at up to 80 amps. In 2008, CARB published a new standard that mandated the usage of the new connector beginning with the 2010 model year; [ 7 ] this was approved in 2012. [ 8 ] The Yazaki plug that was built to the new SAE J1772 plug standard successfully completed certification at UL . The standard specification was subsequently voted upon by the SAE committee in July 2009. [ 9 ] On January 14, 2010, the SAE J1772 REV 2009 was adopted by the SAE Motor Vehicle Council. [ 10 ] The companies participating in or supporting the revised 2009 standard include smart , Chrysler , GM , Ford , Toyota , Honda , Nissan , Rivian , and Tesla . The SAE J1772-2009 connector specification was subsequently added to the international IEC 62196-2 standard (\u201cPart 2: Dimensional compatibility and interchangeability requirements for a.c. pin and contact-tube accessories\u201d) with voting on the final specification slated to close in May 2011. [ 11 ] [ needs update ] The SAE J1772 connector is considered a \u201cType 1\u201d implementation providing a single phase coupler. [ 12 ] Vehicle equipment [ edit ] The SAE J1772-2009 was adopted by electric vehicle manufacturers in the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf . The connector became standard equipment in the U.S. market due to the availability of charging stations supporting it in the nation's electric vehicle network (helped by funding such as the ChargePoint America program drawing grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act). [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The European versions were equipped with a SAE J1772-2009 inlet as well until the automotive industry settled on the IEC Type 2 \u201cMennekes\u201d connector as the standard inlet\u00a0\u2013 since all IEC connectors use the same SAE J1772 signaling protocol the car manufacturers are selling cars with either a SAE J1772-2009 inlet or an IEC Type 2 inlet depending on the regional market. There are also (passive) adapters available that can convert J1772-2009 to IEC Type 2 and vice versa. The only difference is that most European versions have an on-board charger that can take advantage of three-phase electric power with higher voltage and current limits even for the same basic electric vehicle model (such as the Chevrolet Volt/Opel Ampera ). [ citation needed ] Combined Charging System (CCS) [ edit ] Main article: Combined Charging System CCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins In 2011, SAE developed a J1772/CCS Combo Coupler variant of the J1772-2009 connector in order to also support the Combined Charging System standard for direct current (DC) fast charging, which includes the standard 5-pin J1772 connector along with an additional two larger pins to support fast DC charging. Combo 1 accommodates charging at 200\u2013920 volts DC and up to 350\u00a0kW. [1] [ needs update ] The combination coupler will also use power-line communication technology to communicate between the vehicle, off-board charger, and smart grid. [ 15 ] Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Porsche, Volvo, and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce the Combined Charging System in mid-2012. [ 16 ] The first vehicles using the SAE Combo plug were the BMW i3 released in late 2013, and the Chevrolet Spark EV released in 2014. [ 17 ] In Europe, the combo coupler is based on the Type 2 (VDE) AC charging connector (Combo 2) maintaining full compatibility with the SAE specification for DC charging and the HomePlug Green PHY PLC protocol. [ 18 ] In 2019 Tesla introduced the Model 3 with a CCS Combo 2 plug in Europe, but has not introduced models with CCS in the US. With the introduction of the Model 3 in Europe, Tesla added CCS charging cables to V2 Superchargers (supporting both CCS Combo 2 and Tesla DC Type 2). European V3 Tesla Superchargers include only a CCS charging cable. [ 19 ] Properties [ edit ] Connector [ edit ] The J1772-2009 connector is designed for single phase alternating current electrical systems with 120\u00a0V or 240\u00a0V such as those used in North America and Japan. The round 43-millimetre (1.7\u00a0in) diameter connector is keyed and has five pins (viewed from outside of the plug): [ 20 ] SAE J1772 / IEC 62196-2-1 Type 1 Row Position Function Notes Top [ a ] 1 L1 \"AC Line 1\" 2 N \"AC Neutral\" for 120 V Level 1 charging or \"AC Line 2\" for 208\u2013240 V Level 2 charging Bottom [ b ] 3 PE \"Protective Earth\" aka Ground Middle [ c ] 4 PP \"Proximity Pilot\" aka \"plug present\", which provides a signal to the vehicle's control system so it can prevent movement while connected to the electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ; i.e., the charging station), and signals the latch release button to the vehicle. [ citation needed ] 5 CP \"Control Pilot\" is a communication line used to negotiate charging level between the car and the EVSE, and it can be manipulated by the vehicle to initiate charging and can carry other information. [ 21 ] The signal is a 1\u00a0kHz square wave at \u00b112 volts generated by the EVSE to detect the presence of the vehicle, communicate the maximum allowable charging current, and control charging begin/end. [ 22 ] ^ Top row is spaced 6.8\u00a0mm (0.27\u00a0in) above the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 15.7\u00a0mm (0.62\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. ^ Bottom row is spaced 10.6\u00a0mm (0.42\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector. ^ Middle row is spaced 5.6\u00a0mm (0.22\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 21.3\u00a0mm (0.84\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. The connector is designed to withstand 10,000 mating cycles (a connection and a disconnection) and exposure to the elements. With 1 mating cycle per day, the connector's lifespan should exceed 27 years. [ 23 ] Release mechanism [ edit ] Black release button on an SAE J1772 plug in a mockup car SAE J1772 plugs operated by thumb at a VinFast charging station Adaptor cable from Nissan with Type 1 plug for the car, Type 2 plug for a European charger socket IEC 62196 Type 2 connector with openings on the side for automatic release The SAE J1772 or Type 1 plug is locked into the car with a hook that is manually operated, mostly by pressing a button with the thumb, which interrupts power. This allows anybody to stop charging and even theft of the cable. To prevent this, the European IEC 62196 Type 2 connector has openings on the side for automatic locking and release, operated by the car owner via remote control. If the car locks or releases its plug, the charger will follow suit according to the PP signal. In addition, the charge port on many modern cars with a J1772 connector have an extendable pin that blocks the J1772 latch from being raised. By extending this pin, it becomes impossible to raise the release latch. In this way, the vehicle can prevent a plugged-in J1772 connector from being removed. This is essential for the CCS implementation where the connector is not designed to break the heavy DC charging current. Charging [ edit ] The SAE J1772-2017 standard defines four levels of charging: AC Level 1 , AC Level 2 , DC Level 1 , and DC Level 2 . [ 24 ] Earlier released revisions of J1772 also listed a never-implemented AC Level 3 , which was considered but never implemented. Charge method Voltage (V) Phase Max. current, continuous (A) Branch circuit breaker rating (A) [ a ] Max. power (kW) AC Level 1 120 1 12 15 1.44 16 20 1.92 AC Level 2 208 or 240 1 24\u201380 30\u2013100 5.0\u201319.2 AC Level 3 [ b ] 208\u2013600 3 63\u2013160 80-200 22.7\u2013166 Charge method Voltage (V) Phase Max. current (A) Max. power (kW) DC Level 1 50\u20131000 \u2013 80 80 DC Level 2 50\u20131000 \u2013 400 400 ^ Per NEC article 625.41, branch circuit rating must be at least 125% of EVSE maximum continuous current ^ As noted in Appendix M of the SAE J1772 standard document, a third AC charge method was considered but never implemented for light vehicles. For heavy and industrial vehicles, this was left to the SAE J3068 Medium and Heavy Duty Vehicle Conductive Charging Task Force Committee which permits the J1772 protocol at 400 VAC or less and requires a newer LIN protocol above 400 VAC (LIN is recommended at all voltages).  J3068 uses the Type 2 ( Mennekes connector ) possibly supplying up to 166\u00a0kW. [ 25 ] The J1772 AC Level 3 mode using single phase power would have provided up to 96\u00a0kW at a nominal voltage of 240 V AC and a maximum current of 400 A.  This power level is closer to what J3068 implemented a decade later at up to 600 VAC, although J3068 version 1 only supports up to 250 amps. For example, the 2020 Chevrolet Bolt has a 66-kWh lithium-ion battery and a 7.2-kW onboard charging module; with an EPA range of 259 miles (417\u00a0km) and energy efficiency of 118\u00a0mpg\u2011e (29\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0mi; 17.7\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0km), [ 26 ] it can use its portable charge cord to charge at AC Level 1 (120 V, 12 A) to get up to 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) of range per hour or go off an AC Level 2 charging unit (240 V, 32 A) to get up to 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) of range per hour. Using an optional DC fast charging (DCFC) port, this model can also charge at up to 55 kW to get up to 180\u00a0mi (290\u00a0km) of range per hour. Other EVs utilizing an 800\u00a0V battery architecture (such as those on Hyundai's E-GMP platform) can charge much faster. According to Hyundai, \"With a 350 kW DC charger, IONIQ 5 can charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. According to WLTP cycle, IONIQ 5 users only need to charge the vehicle for five minutes to get 100 km of range.\" [ 27 ] These vehicles are capable of accepting up to 230kW until about 50% State of charge , allowing these vehicles to recharge much quicker than similar EVs with lower voltage batteries. Some EVs have extended J1772 to allow AC Level 1 (120 V) charging at greater than 16 amps. This is useful, for example, at RV parks where TT-30 (\"Travel Trailer\" - 120 V, 30 A) receptacles are common. These allow charging at up to 24 amps. However, this level of 120 V charging has not been codified into J1772. Another extension, supported by the North American Charging System , is Level 2 charging at 277 V.  Like 208 V, 277 V is commonly found in North American commercial three-phase circuits. Safety [ edit ] The J1772 standard includes several levels of shock protection, ensuring the safety of charging even in wet conditions.  Physically, the connection pins are isolated on the interior of the connector when mated, ensuring no physical access to those pins.  When not mated, J1772 connectors have no power at the pins; [ 28 ] they are not energized until commanded by the vehicle. [ 29 ] The proximity detection pin is connected to a switch in the connector release button. Pressing the release button causes the vehicle to stop drawing current. As the connector is removed, the shorter control pilot pin disconnects first, causing the EVSE to drop power to the plug. This also ensures that the power pins will not be disconnected under load, causing arcs and shortening their life. The ground pin is longer than the other pins, so it breaks last. Signaling [ edit ] J1772 signaling circuit The signaling protocol has been designed for the following charging sequence. [ 29 ] supply equipment signals presence of AC input power vehicle detects plug via proximity circuit (thus the vehicle can prevent driving away while connected) and can detect when latch is pressed in preparation for plug removal. Control Pilot (CP) functions begin supply equipment detects plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) supply equipment indicates to PEV readiness to supply current PEV ventilation requirements are determined supply equipment current capacity provided to PEV PEV commands energy flow PEV and supply equipment continuously monitor continuity of safety ground charge continues as determined by PEV charge may be interrupted by disconnecting the plug from the vehicle The technical specification was described first in the 2001 version of SAE J1772 and subsequently the IEC 61851 -1 and IEC TS 62763:2013. The charging station puts 12\u00a0V on the Control Pilot (CP) and the Proximity Pilot (AKA Plug Present: PP) measuring the voltage differences. This protocol does not require integrated circuits, which would be required for other charging protocols, making the SAE J1772 robust and operable through a temperature range of \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to +85\u00a0\u00b0C. Control Pilot [ edit ] Control Pilot (Mode) : The charging station sends a 1\u00a0kHz square wave on the control pilot that is connected back to the protective earth on the vehicle side by means of a resistor and a diode (voltage range \u00b112.0\u00b10.4\u00a0V). The live wires of public charging stations are always dead if the CP\u2013PE ( Protective Earth ) circuit is open, although the standard allows a charging current as in Mode 1 (maximum 16\u00a0A). If the circuit is closed, the charging station can also verify that the protective earth is functional. The vehicle can request a certain charging function by setting the resistance between the CP and PE pins; 2.7\u00a0k\u03a9 announces a Mode 3 compatible vehicle ( vehicle detected ) which does not require charging. 880\u00a0\u03a9 says the vehicle is ready to be charged, and 240\u00a0\u03a9 requests with ventilation charging, in which case the charging stations supplies charging power only if the area is ventilated (i.e., outdoors). The Control Pilot line circuitry examples in SAE J1772:2001 show that the current loop CP\u2013PE is connected permanently on the vehicle side via a 2.74\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor, making for a voltage drop from +12\u00a0V to +9\u00a0V when a cable is hooked up to the charging station, which activates the wave generator. The charging is activated by the vehicle by adding parallel 1.3\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor resulting in a voltage drop to +6\u00a0V or by adding a parallel 270\u00a0\u03a9 resistor for a required ventilation resulting in a voltage drop to +3\u00a0V. Hence the charging station can react by only checking the voltage range present on the CP\u2013PE loop. [ 30 ] Note that the diode will only make for a voltage drop in the positive range; any negative voltage on the CP\u2013PE loop is blocked by D1 in the vehicle, any significant current that does flow in the CP\u2013PE loop during the negative period will shut off the current as being considered a fatal error (like touching the pins). For IEC62196-2 male plugs the Control Pilot pin is made shorter to prevent untethered cables being used as \"extension leads\", This prevents the use of downstream cables that may have a lower current capability being connected to a cable of a higher current rating.

[ 31 ] The PWM duty cycle of the 1\u00a0kHz CP signal indicates the maximum allowed mains current. According to the SAE it includes socket outlet, cable and vehicle inlet. In the US, the definition of the ampacity (ampere capacity, or current capacity) is split for continuous and short term operation. [ 31 ] The SAE defines the ampacity value to be derived by a formula based on the 1\u00a0ms full cycle (of the 1\u00a0kHz signal) with the maximum continuous ampere rating being 0.6\u00a0A per 10\u00a0\u03bcs up to 850\u00a0\u03bcs (with the lowest (100\u00a0\u03bcs/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 0.6\u00a0A = 6\u00a0A).  Above 850\u00a0\u03bcs, the formula requires subtraction of 640\u00a0\u03bcs and multiplying the difference by 2.5.  For example ((960\u00a0\u03bcs \u2212 640\u00a0\u03bcs)/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 2.5\u00a0A = 80\u00a0A.

During charging, the EVSE side connects the PP\u2013PE loop via S3 and a 150\u00a0\u03a9 R6; when opening the release actuator a 330\u00a0\u03a9 R7 is added in the PP\u2013PE loop on the EVSE side which gives a voltage shift on the line to allow the electric vehicle to initiate a controlled shut off prior to actual disconnection of the charge power pins. However, many low-power adapter cables do not offer that locking actuator state detection on the PP pin. Under IEC 62196 the Proximity Pin is also used to indicate the cable capacity \u2013 this is relevant for non-tethered EVSEs. The resistor is coded to the maximum current capability of the cable assembly. The EV interrupts the current supply if the current capability of the cable is exceeded as detected by the measurement of the Rc (shown as R6 in the J1772 signaling circuit above), as defined by the values for the recommended interpretation range. Rc is placed between the PP and PE, within the detachable cable assembly.

[ 33 ] P1901 communication is compatible with other 802.x standards via the IEEE 1905 standard, allowing arbitrary IP-based communications with the vehicle, meter or distributor, and the building where chargers are located.  P1905 includes wireless communications. In at least one implementation, communication between the off-board DC EVSE and PEV occurs on the pilot wire of the SAE J1772 connector via HomePlug Green PHY power line communication (PLC). [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Competing standards [ edit ] A competing proposal known as the Mennekes connector initiated by RWE and Daimler was standardized in 2011's IEC 62196 as its Type 2 connector. It has been widely adopted as the European Union's standard single- and three-phase coupler. [ 12 ] [ 37 ] The connector adopted the same protocols for the pilot pin as J1772's J-Plug. The IEC specification allows for up to 63\u00a0A and 43.6\u00a0kW.  In 2018, the SAE J3068 committee released an enhancement to the EU connector tailored for the North American industrial market allowing up to 160\u00a0A / 166\u00a0kW on 3\u03c6 power . The same IEC\u00a062196-2 standard also specified a pair of Type 3 connector from Scame Global providing a single- and three-phase coupler with shutters. [ 12 ] After a 2016 approval by the IEC for a small modification to the Mennekes connector optionally allowing shutters, Type 3 has been deprecated. Tokyo Electric Power Company has developed a specification solely for automotive high-voltage DC fast charging using the JARI DC connector and formed the CHAdeMO ( charge de move , equivalent to \"charge for moving\") association with Japanese automakers Mitsubishi , Nissan and Subaru to promote it.

SAE J1772 , also known as a J plug or Type 1 connector after its international standard, IEC 62196 Type 1, is a North American standard for electrical connectors for electric vehicles maintained by SAE International under the formal title \"SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice J1772, SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler\". [ 1 ] The SAE maintains the general physical, electrical, communication protocol, and performance requirements for the electric vehicle conductive charge system and coupler. The intent is to define a common electric vehicle conductive charging system architecture including operational requirements and the functional and dimensional requirements for the vehicle inlet and mating connector. The J1772 5-pin standard supports a wide range of single-phase (1\u03c6) alternating current (AC) charging rates. They range from portable devices that can connect to a household NEMA 5-15 outlet that can deliver 1.44\u00a0kW (12\u00a0A @ 120\u00a0V) to hardwired equipment that can deliver up to 19.2\u00a0kW (80\u00a0A @ 240\u00a0V). [ 2 ] These connectors are sometimes informally referred to as chargers, but they are \" electric vehicle supply equipment \" (EVSE), since they only supply AC power to the vehicle's on-board charger, which then converts it to the direct current (DC) needed to recharge the battery. The Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 1 connector builds on the standard, adding two additional pins for DC fast charging up to 350\u00a0kW. History [ edit ] The older Avcon connector, featured here on a Ford Ranger EV The main stimulus for the development of SAE J1772 came from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Early electric vehicles like the General Motors EV1 and Toyota RAV4 EV used Magne Charge (SAE J1773), an inductive system. CARB rejected the inductive technology in favor of conductive coupling to supply electricity for recharging. In June 2001, CARB adopted the SAE J1772-2001 standard as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] This early version of the connector was made by Avcon and featured a rectangular connector capable of delivering up to 6.6\u00a0kW of electrical power. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The California regulations mandated the usage of SAE J1772-2001 beginning with the 2006 model year. CARB would later ask for higher current delivery than the 6.6\u00a0kW that the 2001 J1772 (Avcon) standard supported. This process led to the proposal of a new round connector design by Yazaki which allowed for an increased power delivery of up to 19.2\u00a0kW delivered via single phase 120\u2013240 V AC at up to 80 amps. In 2008, CARB published a new standard that mandated the usage of the new connector beginning with the 2010 model year; [ 7 ] this was approved in 2012. [ 8 ] The Yazaki plug that was built to the new SAE J1772 plug standard successfully completed certification at UL . The standard specification was subsequently voted upon by the SAE committee in July 2009. [ 9 ] On January 14, 2010, the SAE J1772 REV 2009 was adopted by the SAE Motor Vehicle Council. [ 10 ] The companies participating in or supporting the revised 2009 standard include smart , Chrysler , GM , Ford , Toyota , Honda , Nissan , Rivian , and Tesla . The SAE J1772-2009 connector specification was subsequently added to the international IEC 62196-2 standard (\u201cPart 2: Dimensional compatibility and interchangeability requirements for a.c. pin and contact-tube accessories\u201d) with voting on the final specification slated to close in May 2011. [ 11 ] [ needs update ] The SAE J1772 connector is considered a \u201cType 1\u201d implementation providing a single phase coupler. [ 12 ] Vehicle equipment [ edit ] The SAE J1772-2009 was adopted by electric vehicle manufacturers in the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf . The connector became standard equipment in the U.S. market due to the availability of charging stations supporting it in the nation's electric vehicle network (helped by funding such as the ChargePoint America program drawing grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act). [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The European versions were equipped with a SAE J1772-2009 inlet as well until the automotive industry settled on the IEC Type 2 \u201cMennekes\u201d connector as the standard inlet\u00a0\u2013 since all IEC connectors use the same SAE J1772 signaling protocol the car manufacturers are selling cars with either a SAE J1772-2009 inlet or an IEC Type 2 inlet depending on the regional market. There are also (passive) adapters available that can convert J1772-2009 to IEC Type 2 and vice versa. The only difference is that most European versions have an on-board charger that can take advantage of three-phase electric power with higher voltage and current limits even for the same basic electric vehicle model (such as the Chevrolet Volt/Opel Ampera ). [ citation needed ] Combined Charging System (CCS) [ edit ] Main article: Combined Charging System CCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins In 2011, SAE developed a J1772/CCS Combo Coupler variant of the J1772-2009 connector in order to also support the Combined Charging System standard for direct current (DC) fast charging, which includes the standard 5-pin J1772 connector along with an additional two larger pins to support fast DC charging. Combo 1 accommodates charging at 200\u2013920 volts DC and up to 350\u00a0kW. [1] [ needs update ] The combination coupler will also use power-line communication technology to communicate between the vehicle, off-board charger, and smart grid. [ 15 ] Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Porsche, Volvo, and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce the Combined Charging System in mid-2012. [ 16 ] The first vehicles using the SAE Combo plug were the BMW i3 released in late 2013, and the Chevrolet Spark EV released in 2014. [ 17 ] In Europe, the combo coupler is based on the Type 2 (VDE) AC charging connector (Combo 2) maintaining full compatibility with the SAE specification for DC charging and the HomePlug Green PHY PLC protocol. [ 18 ] In 2019 Tesla introduced the Model 3 with a CCS Combo 2 plug in Europe, but has not introduced models with CCS in the US. With the introduction of the Model 3 in Europe, Tesla added CCS charging cables to V2 Superchargers (supporting both CCS Combo 2 and Tesla DC Type 2). European V3 Tesla Superchargers include only a CCS charging cable. [ 19 ] Properties [ edit ] Connector [ edit ] The J1772-2009 connector is designed for single phase alternating current electrical systems with 120\u00a0V or 240\u00a0V such as those used in North America and Japan. The round 43-millimetre (1.7\u00a0in) diameter connector is keyed and has five pins (viewed from outside of the plug): [ 20 ] SAE J1772 / IEC 62196-2-1 Type 1 Row Position Function Notes Top [ a ] 1 L1 \"AC Line 1\" 2 N \"AC Neutral\" for 120 V Level 1 charging or \"AC Line 2\" for 208\u2013240 V Level 2 charging Bottom [ b ] 3 PE \"Protective Earth\" aka Ground Middle [ c ] 4 PP \"Proximity Pilot\" aka \"plug present\", which provides a signal to the vehicle's control system so it can prevent movement while connected to the electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE ; i.e., the charging station), and signals the latch release button to the vehicle. [ citation needed ] 5 CP \"Control Pilot\" is a communication line used to negotiate charging level between the car and the EVSE, and it can be manipulated by the vehicle to initiate charging and can carry other information. [ 21 ] The signal is a 1\u00a0kHz square wave at \u00b112 volts generated by the EVSE to detect the presence of the vehicle, communicate the maximum allowable charging current, and control charging begin/end. [ 22 ] ^ Top row is spaced 6.8\u00a0mm (0.27\u00a0in) above the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 15.7\u00a0mm (0.62\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. ^ Bottom row is spaced 10.6\u00a0mm (0.42\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector. ^ Middle row is spaced 5.6\u00a0mm (0.22\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 21.3\u00a0mm (0.84\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. The connector is designed to withstand 10,000 mating cycles (a connection and a disconnection) and exposure to the elements. With 1 mating cycle per day, the connector's lifespan should exceed 27 years. [ 23 ] Release mechanism [ edit ] Black release button on an SAE J1772 plug in a mockup car SAE J1772 plugs operated by thumb at a VinFast charging station Adaptor cable from Nissan with Type 1 plug for the car, Type 2 plug for a European charger socket IEC 62196 Type 2 connector with openings on the side for automatic release The SAE J1772 or Type 1 plug is locked into the car with a hook that is manually operated, mostly by pressing a button with the thumb, which interrupts power. This allows anybody to stop charging and even theft of the cable. To prevent this, the European IEC 62196 Type 2 connector has openings on the side for automatic locking and release, operated by the car owner via remote control. If the car locks or releases its plug, the charger will follow suit according to the PP signal. In addition, the charge port on many modern cars with a J1772 connector have an extendable pin that blocks the J1772 latch from being raised. By extending this pin, it becomes impossible to raise the release latch. In this way, the vehicle can prevent a plugged-in J1772 connector from being removed. This is essential for the CCS implementation where the connector is not designed to break the heavy DC charging current. Charging [ edit ] The SAE J1772-2017 standard defines four levels of charging: AC Level 1 , AC Level 2 , DC Level 1 , and DC Level 2 . [ 24 ] Earlier released revisions of J1772 also listed a never-implemented AC Level 3 , which was considered but never implemented. Charge method Voltage (V) Phase Max. current, continuous (A) Branch circuit breaker rating (A) [ a ] Max. power (kW) AC Level 1 120 1 12 15 1.44 16 20 1.92 AC Level 2 208 or 240 1 24\u201380 30\u2013100 5.0\u201319.2 AC Level 3 [ b ] 208\u2013600 3 63\u2013160 80-200 22.7\u2013166 Charge method Voltage (V) Phase Max. current (A) Max. power (kW) DC Level 1 50\u20131000 \u2013 80 80 DC Level 2 50\u20131000 \u2013 400 400 ^ Per NEC article 625.41, branch circuit rating must be at least 125% of EVSE maximum continuous current ^ As noted in Appendix M of the SAE J1772 standard document, a third AC charge method was considered but never implemented for light vehicles. For heavy and industrial vehicles, this was left to the SAE J3068 Medium and Heavy Duty Vehicle Conductive Charging Task Force Committee which permits the J1772 protocol at 400 VAC or less and requires a newer LIN protocol above 400 VAC (LIN is recommended at all voltages).  J3068 uses the Type 2 ( Mennekes connector ) possibly supplying up to 166\u00a0kW. [ 25 ] The J1772 AC Level 3 mode using single phase power would have provided up to 96\u00a0kW at a nominal voltage of 240 V AC and a maximum current of 400 A.  This power level is closer to what J3068 implemented a decade later at up to 600 VAC, although J3068 version 1 only supports up to 250 amps. For example, the 2020 Chevrolet Bolt has a 66-kWh lithium-ion battery and a 7.2-kW onboard charging module; with an EPA range of 259 miles (417\u00a0km) and energy efficiency of 118\u00a0mpg\u2011e (29\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0mi; 17.7\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0km), [ 26 ] it can use its portable charge cord to charge at AC Level 1 (120 V, 12 A) to get up to 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) of range per hour or go off an AC Level 2 charging unit (240 V, 32 A) to get up to 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) of range per hour. Using an optional DC fast charging (DCFC) port, this model can also charge at up to 55 kW to get up to 180\u00a0mi (290\u00a0km) of range per hour. Other EVs utilizing an 800\u00a0V battery architecture (such as those on Hyundai's E-GMP platform) can charge much faster. According to Hyundai, \"With a 350 kW DC charger, IONIQ 5 can charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. According to WLTP cycle, IONIQ 5 users only need to charge the vehicle for five minutes to get 100 km of range.\" [ 27 ] These vehicles are capable of accepting up to 230kW until about 50% State of charge , allowing these vehicles to recharge much quicker than similar EVs with lower voltage batteries. Some EVs have extended J1772 to allow AC Level 1 (120 V) charging at greater than 16 amps. This is useful, for example, at RV parks where TT-30 (\"Travel Trailer\" - 120 V, 30 A) receptacles are common. These allow charging at up to 24 amps. However, this level of 120 V charging has not been codified into J1772. Another extension, supported by the North American Charging System , is Level 2 charging at 277 V.  Like 208 V, 277 V is commonly found in North American commercial three-phase circuits. Safety [ edit ] The J1772 standard includes several levels of shock protection, ensuring the safety of charging even in wet conditions.  Physically, the connection pins are isolated on the interior of the connector when mated, ensuring no physical access to those pins.  When not mated, J1772 connectors have no power at the pins; [ 28 ] they are not energized until commanded by the vehicle. [ 29 ] The proximity detection pin is connected to a switch in the connector release button. Pressing the release button causes the vehicle to stop drawing current. As the connector is removed, the shorter control pilot pin disconnects first, causing the EVSE to drop power to the plug. This also ensures that the power pins will not be disconnected under load, causing arcs and shortening their life. The ground pin is longer than the other pins, so it breaks last. Signaling [ edit ] J1772 signaling circuit The signaling protocol has been designed for the following charging sequence. [ 29 ] supply equipment signals presence of AC input power vehicle detects plug via proximity circuit (thus the vehicle can prevent driving away while connected) and can detect when latch is pressed in preparation for plug removal. Control Pilot (CP) functions begin supply equipment detects plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) supply equipment indicates to PEV readiness to supply current PEV ventilation requirements are determined supply equipment current capacity provided to PEV PEV commands energy flow PEV and supply equipment continuously monitor continuity of safety ground charge continues as determined by PEV charge may be interrupted by disconnecting the plug from the vehicle The technical specification was described first in the 2001 version of SAE J1772 and subsequently the IEC 61851 -1 and IEC TS 62763:2013. The charging station puts 12\u00a0V on the Control Pilot (CP) and the Proximity Pilot (AKA Plug Present: PP) measuring the voltage differences. This protocol does not require integrated circuits, which would be required for other charging protocols, making the SAE J1772 robust and operable through a temperature range of \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to +85\u00a0\u00b0C. Control Pilot [ edit ] Control Pilot (Mode) : The charging station sends a 1\u00a0kHz square wave on the control pilot that is connected back to the protective earth on the vehicle side by means of a resistor and a diode (voltage range \u00b112.0\u00b10.4\u00a0V). The live wires of public charging stations are always dead if the CP\u2013PE ( Protective Earth ) circuit is open, although the standard allows a charging current as in Mode 1 (maximum 16\u00a0A). If the circuit is closed, the charging station can also verify that the protective earth is functional. The vehicle can request a certain charging function by setting the resistance between the CP and PE pins; 2.7\u00a0k\u03a9 announces a Mode 3 compatible vehicle ( vehicle detected ) which does not require charging. 880\u00a0\u03a9 says the vehicle is ready to be charged, and 240\u00a0\u03a9 requests with ventilation charging, in which case the charging stations supplies charging power only if the area is ventilated (i.e., outdoors). The Control Pilot line circuitry examples in SAE J1772:2001 show that the current loop CP\u2013PE is connected permanently on the vehicle side via a 2.74\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor, making for a voltage drop from +12\u00a0V to +9\u00a0V when a cable is hooked up to the charging station, which activates the wave generator. The charging is activated by the vehicle by adding parallel 1.3\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor resulting in a voltage drop to +6\u00a0V or by adding a parallel 270\u00a0\u03a9 resistor for a required ventilation resulting in a voltage drop to +3\u00a0V. Hence the charging station can react by only checking the voltage range present on the CP\u2013PE loop. [ 30 ] Note that the diode will only make for a voltage drop in the positive range; any negative voltage on the CP\u2013PE loop is blocked by D1 in the vehicle, any significant current that does flow in the CP\u2013PE loop during the negative period will shut off the current as being considered a fatal error (like touching the pins). For IEC62196-2 male plugs the Control Pilot pin is made shorter to prevent untethered cables being used as \"extension leads\", This prevents the use of downstream cables that may have a lower current capability being connected to a cable of a higher current rating.

[ 31 ] The PWM duty cycle of the 1\u00a0kHz CP signal indicates the maximum allowed mains current. According to the SAE it includes socket outlet, cable and vehicle inlet. In the US, the definition of the ampacity (ampere capacity, or current capacity) is split for continuous and short term operation. [ 31 ] The SAE defines the ampacity value to be derived by a formula based on the 1\u00a0ms full cycle (of the 1\u00a0kHz signal) with the maximum continuous ampere rating being 0.6\u00a0A per 10\u00a0\u03bcs up to 850\u00a0\u03bcs (with the lowest (100\u00a0\u03bcs/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 0.6\u00a0A = 6\u00a0A).  Above 850\u00a0\u03bcs, the formula requires subtraction of 640\u00a0\u03bcs and multiplying the difference by 2.5.  For example ((960\u00a0\u03bcs \u2212 640\u00a0\u03bcs)/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 2.5\u00a0A = 80\u00a0A.

During charging, the EVSE side connects the PP\u2013PE loop via S3 and a 150\u00a0\u03a9 R6; when opening the release actuator a 330\u00a0\u03a9 R7 is added in the PP\u2013PE loop on the EVSE side which gives a voltage shift on the line to allow the electric vehicle to initiate a controlled shut off prior to actual disconnection of the charge power pins. However, many low-power adapter cables do not offer that locking actuator state detection on the PP pin. Under IEC 62196 the Proximity Pin is also used to indicate the cable capacity \u2013 this is relevant for non-tethered EVSEs. The resistor is coded to the maximum current capability of the cable assembly. The EV interrupts the current supply if the current capability of the cable is exceeded as detected by the measurement of the Rc (shown as R6 in the J1772 signaling circuit above), as defined by the values for the recommended interpretation range. Rc is placed between the PP and PE, within the detachable cable assembly.

[ 33 ] P1901 communication is compatible with other 802.x standards via the IEEE 1905 standard, allowing arbitrary IP-based communications with the vehicle, meter or distributor, and the building where chargers are located.  P1905 includes wireless communications. In at least one implementation, communication between the off-board DC EVSE and PEV occurs on the pilot wire of the SAE J1772 connector via HomePlug Green PHY power line communication (PLC). [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Competing standards [ edit ] A competing proposal known as the Mennekes connector initiated by RWE and Daimler was standardized in 2011's IEC 62196 as its Type 2 connector. It has been widely adopted as the European Union's standard single- and three-phase coupler. [ 12 ] [ 37 ] The connector adopted the same protocols for the pilot pin as J1772's J-Plug. The IEC specification allows for up to 63\u00a0A and 43.6\u00a0kW.  In 2018, the SAE J3068 committee released an enhancement to the EU connector tailored for the North American industrial market allowing up to 160\u00a0A / 166\u00a0kW on 3\u03c6 power . The same IEC\u00a062196-2 standard also specified a pair of Type 3 connector from Scame Global providing a single- and three-phase coupler with shutters. [ 12 ] After a 2016 approval by the IEC for a small modification to the Mennekes connector optionally allowing shutters, Type 3 has been deprecated. Tokyo Electric Power Company has developed a specification solely for automotive high-voltage DC fast charging using the JARI DC connector and formed the CHAdeMO ( charge de move , equivalent to \"charge for moving\") association with Japanese automakers Mitsubishi , Nissan and Subaru to promote it.

[ 1 ]\nThe SAE maintains the general physical, electrical, communication protocol, and performance requirements for the electric vehicle conductive charge system and coupler. The intent is to define a common electric vehicle conductive charging system architecture including operational requirements and the functional and dimensional requirements for the vehicle inlet and mating connector.\nThe J1772 5-pin standard supports a wide range of single-phase (1\u03c6) alternating current (AC) charging rates. They range from portable devices that can connect to a household NEMA 5-15 outlet that can deliver 1.44\u00a0kW (12\u00a0A @ 120\u00a0V) to hardwired equipment that can deliver up to 19.2\u00a0kW (80\u00a0A @ 240\u00a0V). [ 2 ] These connectors are sometimes informally referred to as chargers, but they are \" electric vehicle supply equipment \" (EVSE), since they only supply AC power to the vehicle's on-board charger, which then converts it to the direct current (DC) needed to recharge the battery.\nThe Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 1 connector builds on the standard, adding two additional pins for DC fast charging up to 350\u00a0kW.\nHistory [ edit ]\nHistory\nThe main stimulus for the development of SAE J1772 came from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Early electric vehicles like the General Motors EV1 and Toyota RAV4 EV used Magne Charge (SAE J1773), an inductive system. CARB rejected the inductive technology in favor of conductive coupling to supply electricity for recharging. In June 2001, CARB adopted the SAE J1772-2001 standard as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] This early version of the connector was made by Avcon and featured a rectangular connector capable of delivering up to 6.6\u00a0kW of electrical power. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The California regulations mandated the usage of SAE J1772-2001 beginning with the 2006 model year.\nCARB would later ask for higher current delivery than the 6.6\u00a0kW that the 2001 J1772 (Avcon) standard supported. This process led to the proposal of a new round connector design by Yazaki which allowed for an increased power delivery of up to 19.2\u00a0kW delivered via single phase 120\u2013240 V AC at up to 80 amps. In 2008, CARB published a new standard that mandated the usage of the new connector beginning with the 2010 model year; [ 7 ] this was approved in 2012. [ 8 ]\nThe Yazaki plug that was built to the new SAE J1772 plug standard successfully completed certification at UL . The standard specification was subsequently voted upon by the SAE committee in July 2009. [ 9 ] On January 14, 2010, the SAE J1772 REV 2009 was adopted by the SAE Motor Vehicle Council. [ 10 ] The companies participating in or supporting the revised 2009 standard include smart , Chrysler , GM , Ford , Toyota , Honda , Nissan , Rivian , and Tesla .\nThe SAE J1772-2009 connector specification was subsequently added to the international IEC 62196-2 standard (\u201cPart 2: Dimensional compatibility and interchangeability requirements for a.c. pin and contact-tube accessories\u201d) with voting on the final specification slated to close in May 2011. [ 11 ] [ needs update ] The SAE J1772 connector is considered a \u201cType 1\u201d implementation providing a single phase coupler. [ 12 ]\nVehicle equipment [ edit ]\nVehicle equipment\nThe SAE J1772-2009 was adopted by electric vehicle manufacturers in the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf . The connector became standard equipment in the U.S. market due to the availability of charging stations supporting it in the nation's electric vehicle network (helped by funding such as the ChargePoint America program drawing grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act). [ 13 ] [ 14 ]\nThe European versions were equipped with a SAE J1772-2009 inlet as well until the automotive industry settled on the IEC Type 2 \u201cMennekes\u201d connector as the standard inlet\u00a0\u2013 since all IEC connectors use the same SAE J1772 signaling protocol the car manufacturers are selling cars with either a SAE J1772-2009 inlet or an IEC Type 2 inlet depending on the regional market. There are also (passive) adapters available that can convert J1772-2009 to IEC Type 2 and vice versa. The only difference is that most European versions have an on-board charger that can take advantage of three-phase electric power with higher voltage and current limits even for the same basic electric vehicle model (such as the Chevrolet Volt/Opel Ampera ). [ citation needed ]\nCombined Charging System (CCS) [ edit ]\nCombined Charging System (CCS)\nMain article: Combined Charging System\nIn 2011, SAE developed a J1772/CCS Combo Coupler variant of the J1772-2009 connector in order to also support the Combined Charging System standard for direct current (DC) fast charging, which includes the standard 5-pin J1772 connector along with an additional two larger pins to support fast DC charging. Combo 1 accommodates charging at 200\u2013920 volts DC and up to 350\u00a0kW. [1] [ needs update ] The combination coupler will also use power-line communication technology to communicate between the vehicle, off-board charger, and smart grid. [ 15 ] Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Porsche, Volvo, and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce the Combined Charging System in mid-2012. [ 16 ] The first vehicles using the SAE Combo plug were the BMW i3 released in late 2013, and the Chevrolet Spark EV released in 2014. [ 17 ]\nIn Europe, the combo coupler is based on the Type 2 (VDE) AC charging connector (Combo 2) maintaining full compatibility with the SAE specification for DC charging and the HomePlug Green PHY PLC protocol. [ 18 ] In 2019 Tesla introduced the Model 3 with a CCS Combo 2 plug in Europe, but has not introduced models with CCS in the US. With the introduction of the Model 3 in Europe, Tesla added CCS charging cables to V2 Superchargers (supporting both CCS Combo 2 and Tesla DC Type 2). European V3 Tesla Superchargers include only a CCS charging cable. [ 19 ]\nProperties [ edit ]\nProperties\nConnector [ edit ]\nConnector\nThe J1772-2009 connector is designed for single phase alternating current electrical systems with 120\u00a0V or 240\u00a0V such as those used in North America and Japan. The round 43-millimetre (1.7\u00a0in) diameter connector is keyed and has five pins (viewed from outside of the plug): [ 20 ]\n^ Top row is spaced 6.8\u00a0mm (0.27\u00a0in) above the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 15.7\u00a0mm (0.62\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. ^ Bottom row is spaced 10.6\u00a0mm (0.42\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector. ^ Middle row is spaced 5.6\u00a0mm (0.22\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 21.3\u00a0mm (0.84\u00a0in) apart about the centerline.\n^ Top row is spaced 6.8\u00a0mm (0.27\u00a0in) above the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 15.7\u00a0mm (0.62\u00a0in) apart about the centerline. ^ Bottom row is spaced 10.6\u00a0mm (0.42\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector. ^ Middle row is spaced 5.6\u00a0mm (0.22\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 21.3\u00a0mm (0.84\u00a0in) apart about the centerline.\n^ Top row is spaced 6.8\u00a0mm (0.27\u00a0in) above the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 15.7\u00a0mm (0.62\u00a0in) apart about the centerline.\n^ Bottom row is spaced 10.6\u00a0mm (0.42\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector.\n^ Middle row is spaced 5.6\u00a0mm (0.22\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 21.3\u00a0mm (0.84\u00a0in) apart about the centerline.\nThe connector is designed to withstand 10,000 mating cycles (a connection and a disconnection) and exposure to the elements. With 1 mating cycle per day, the connector's lifespan should exceed 27 years. [ 23 ]\nRelease mechanism [ edit ]\nRelease mechanism\nBlack release button on an SAE J1772 plug in a mockup car\n\nBlack release button on an SAE J1772 plug in a mockup car\nSAE J1772 plugs operated by thumb at a VinFast charging station\n\nSAE J1772 plugs operated by thumb at a VinFast charging station\nAdaptor cable from Nissan with Type 1 plug for the car, Type 2 plug for a European charger socket\n\nAdaptor cable from Nissan with Type 1 plug for the car, Type 2 plug for a European charger socket\nIEC 62196 Type 2 connector with openings on the side for automatic release\n\nIEC 62196 Type 2 connector with openings on the side for automatic release\nThe SAE J1772 or Type 1 plug is locked into the car with a hook that is manually operated, mostly by pressing a button with the thumb, which interrupts power. This allows anybody to stop charging and even theft of the cable. To prevent this, the European IEC 62196 Type 2 connector has openings on the side for automatic locking and release, operated by the car owner via remote control. If the car locks or releases its plug, the charger will follow suit according to the PP signal.\nIn addition, the charge port on many modern cars with a J1772 connector have an extendable pin that blocks the J1772 latch from being raised. By extending this pin, it becomes impossible to raise the release latch. In this way, the vehicle can prevent a plugged-in J1772 connector from being removed. This is essential for the CCS implementation where the connector is not designed to break the heavy DC charging current.\nCharging [ edit ]\nCharging\nThe SAE J1772-2017 standard defines four levels of charging: AC Level 1 , AC Level 2 , DC Level 1 , and DC Level 2 . [ 24 ] Earlier released revisions of J1772 also listed a never-implemented AC Level 3 , which was considered but never implemented.\n^ Per NEC article 625.41, branch circuit rating must be at least 125% of EVSE maximum continuous current ^ As noted in Appendix M of the SAE J1772 standard document, a third AC charge method was considered but never implemented for light vehicles. For heavy and industrial vehicles, this was left to the SAE J3068 Medium and Heavy Duty Vehicle Conductive Charging Task Force Committee which permits the J1772 protocol at 400 VAC or less and requires a newer LIN protocol above 400 VAC (LIN is recommended at all voltages).  J3068 uses the Type 2 ( Mennekes connector ) possibly supplying up to 166\u00a0kW. [ 25 ] The J1772 AC Level 3 mode using single phase power would have provided up to 96\u00a0kW at a nominal voltage of 240 V AC and a maximum current of 400 A.  This power level is closer to what J3068 implemented a decade later at up to 600 VAC, although J3068 version 1 only supports up to 250 amps.\n^ Per NEC article 625.41, branch circuit rating must be at least 125% of EVSE maximum continuous current ^ As noted in Appendix M of the SAE J1772 standard document, a third AC charge method was considered but never implemented for light vehicles.

Using an optional DC fast charging (DCFC) port, this model can also charge at up to 55 kW to get up to 180\u00a0mi (290\u00a0km) of range per hour.\nOther EVs utilizing an 800\u00a0V battery architecture (such as those on Hyundai's E-GMP platform) can charge much faster. According to Hyundai, \"With a 350 kW DC charger, IONIQ 5 can charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. According to WLTP cycle, IONIQ 5 users only need to charge the vehicle for five minutes to get 100 km of range.\" [ 27 ] These vehicles are capable of accepting up to 230kW until about 50% State of charge , allowing these vehicles to recharge much quicker than similar EVs with lower voltage batteries.\nSome EVs have extended J1772 to allow AC Level 1 (120 V) charging at greater than 16 amps. This is useful, for example, at RV parks where TT-30 (\"Travel Trailer\" - 120 V, 30 A) receptacles are common. These allow charging at up to 24 amps. However, this level of 120 V charging has not been codified into J1772.\nAnother extension, supported by the North American Charging System , is Level 2 charging at 277 V.  Like 208 V, 277 V is commonly found in North American commercial three-phase circuits.\nSafety [ edit ]\nSafety\nThe J1772 standard includes several levels of shock protection, ensuring the safety of charging even in wet conditions.  Physically, the connection pins are isolated on the interior of the connector when mated, ensuring no physical access to those pins.  When not mated, J1772 connectors have no power at the pins; [ 28 ] they are not energized until commanded by the vehicle. [ 29 ]\nThe proximity detection pin is connected to a switch in the connector release button. Pressing the release button causes the vehicle to stop drawing current. As the connector is removed, the shorter control pilot pin disconnects first, causing the EVSE to drop power to the plug. This also ensures that the power pins will not be disconnected under load, causing arcs and shortening their life. The ground pin is longer than the other pins, so it breaks last.\nSignaling [ edit ]\nSignaling\nThe signaling protocol has been designed for the following charging sequence. [ 29 ]\nsupply equipment signals presence of AC input power\nvehicle detects plug via proximity circuit (thus the vehicle can prevent driving away while connected) and can detect when latch is pressed in preparation for plug removal.\nControl Pilot (CP) functions begin supply equipment detects plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) supply equipment indicates to PEV readiness to supply current PEV ventilation requirements are determined supply equipment current capacity provided to PEV\nsupply equipment detects plug-in electric vehicle (PEV)\nsupply equipment indicates to PEV readiness to supply current\nPEV ventilation requirements are determined\nsupply equipment current capacity provided to PEV\nPEV commands energy flow\nPEV and supply equipment continuously monitor continuity of safety ground\ncharge continues as determined by PEV\ncharge may be interrupted by disconnecting the plug from the vehicle\nThe technical specification was described first in the 2001 version of SAE J1772 and subsequently the IEC 61851 -1 and IEC TS 62763:2013. The charging station puts 12\u00a0V on the Control Pilot (CP) and the Proximity Pilot (AKA Plug Present: PP) measuring the voltage differences. This protocol does not require integrated circuits, which would be required for other charging protocols, making the SAE J1772 robust and operable through a temperature range of \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to +85\u00a0\u00b0C.\nControl Pilot [ edit ]\nControl Pilot\nControl Pilot (Mode) : The charging station sends a 1\u00a0kHz square wave on the control pilot that is connected back to the protective earth on the vehicle side by means of a resistor and a diode (voltage range \u00b112.0\u00b10.4\u00a0V). The live wires of public charging stations are always dead if the CP\u2013PE ( Protective Earth ) circuit is open, although the standard allows a charging current as in Mode 1 (maximum 16\u00a0A). If the circuit is closed, the charging station can also verify that the protective earth is functional. The vehicle can request a certain charging function by setting the resistance between the CP and PE pins; 2.7\u00a0k\u03a9 announces a Mode 3 compatible vehicle ( vehicle detected ) which does not require charging. 880\u00a0\u03a9 says the vehicle is ready to be charged, and 240\u00a0\u03a9 requests with ventilation charging, in which case the charging stations supplies charging power only if the area is ventilated (i.e., outdoors).\nThe Control Pilot line circuitry examples in SAE J1772:2001 show that the current loop CP\u2013PE is connected permanently on the vehicle side via a 2.74\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor, making for a voltage drop from +12\u00a0V to +9\u00a0V when a cable is hooked up to the charging station, which activates the wave generator. The charging is activated by the vehicle by adding parallel 1.3\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor resulting in a voltage drop to +6\u00a0V or by adding a parallel 270\u00a0\u03a9 resistor for a required ventilation resulting in a voltage drop to +3\u00a0V. Hence the charging station can react by only checking the voltage range present on the CP\u2013PE loop. [ 30 ] Note that the diode will only make for a voltage drop in the positive range; any negative voltage on the CP\u2013PE loop is blocked by D1 in the vehicle, any significant current that does flow in the CP\u2013PE loop during the negative period will shut off the current as being considered a fatal error (like touching the pins).\nFor IEC62196-2 male plugs the Control Pilot pin is made shorter to prevent untethered cables being used as \"extension leads\", This prevents the use of downstream cables that may have a lower current capability being connected to a cable of a higher current rating.\nControl Pilot (Current limit) : The charging station can use the wave signal to describe the maximum current that is available via the charging station with the help of pulse-width modulation : a 16% PWM is a 10\u00a0A maximum, a 25% PWM is a 16\u00a0A maximum, a 50% PWM is a 32\u00a0A maximum and a 90% PWM flags a fast charge option. [ 31 ]\nThe PWM duty cycle of the 1\u00a0kHz CP signal indicates the maximum allowed mains current. According to the SAE it includes socket outlet, cable and vehicle inlet. In the US, the definition of the ampacity (ampere capacity, or current capacity) is split for continuous and short term operation. [ 31 ] The SAE defines the ampacity value to be derived by a formula based on the 1\u00a0ms full cycle (of the 1\u00a0kHz signal) with the maximum continuous ampere rating being 0.6\u00a0A per 10\u00a0\u03bcs up to 850\u00a0\u03bcs (with the lowest (100\u00a0\u03bcs/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 0.6\u00a0A = 6\u00a0A).  Above 850\u00a0\u03bcs, the formula requires subtraction of 640\u00a0\u03bcs and multiplying the difference by 2.5.  For example ((960\u00a0\u03bcs \u2212 640\u00a0\u03bcs)/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 2.5\u00a0A = 80\u00a0A. [ 30 ]\nProximity Pilot [ edit ]\nProximity Pilot\nThe proximity pin, PP (also known as plug present ), as shown in the SAE J1772 example pinout, describes the switch, S3, as being mechanically linked to the connector latch release actuator. During charging, the EVSE side connects the PP\u2013PE loop via S3 and a 150\u00a0\u03a9 R6; when opening the release actuator a 330\u00a0\u03a9 R7 is added in the PP\u2013PE loop on the EVSE side which gives a voltage shift on the line to allow the electric vehicle to initiate a controlled shut off prior to actual disconnection of the charge power pins. However, many low-power adapter cables do not offer that locking actuator state detection on the PP pin.\nUnder IEC 62196 the Proximity Pin is also used to indicate the cable capacity \u2013 this is relevant for non-tethered EVSEs.\nThe resistor is coded to the maximum current capability of the cable assembly. The EV interrupts the current supply if the current capability of the cable is exceeded as detected by the measurement of the Rc (shown as R6 in the J1772 signaling circuit above), as defined by the values for the recommended interpretation range.\nRc is placed between the PP and PE, within the detachable cable assembly.\n[ 32 ]\nP1901 powerline communication [ edit ]\nP1901 powerline communication\nIn an updated standard due in 2012, SAE proposes to use power line communication , specifically IEEE 1901 , between the vehicle, off-board charging station , and the smart grid , without requiring an additional pin; SAE and the IEEE Standards Association are sharing their draft standards related to the smart grid and vehicle electrification. [ 33 ]\nP1901 communication is compatible with other 802.x standards via the IEEE 1905 standard, allowing arbitrary IP-based communications with the vehicle, meter or distributor, and the building where chargers are located.  P1905 includes wireless communications. In at least one implementation, communication between the off-board DC EVSE and PEV occurs on the pilot wire of the SAE J1772 connector via HomePlug Green PHY power line communication (PLC). [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ]\nCompeting standards [ edit ]\nCompeting standards\nA competing proposal known as the Mennekes connector initiated by RWE and Daimler was standardized in 2011's IEC 62196 as its Type 2 connector. It has been widely adopted as the European Union's standard single- and three-phase coupler. [ 12 ] [ 37 ] The connector adopted the same protocols for the pilot pin as J1772's J-Plug. The IEC specification allows for up to 63\u00a0A and 43.6\u00a0kW.  In 2018, the SAE J3068 committee released an enhancement to the EU connector tailored for the North American industrial market allowing up to 160\u00a0A / 166\u00a0kW on 3\u03c6 power .\nThe same IEC\u00a062196-2 standard also specified a pair of Type 3 connector from Scame Global providing a single- and three-phase coupler with shutters. [ 12 ] After a 2016 approval by the IEC for a small modification to the Mennekes connector optionally allowing shutters, Type 3 has been deprecated.\nTokyo Electric Power Company has developed a specification solely for automotive high-voltage DC fast charging using the JARI DC connector and formed the CHAdeMO ( charge de move , equivalent to \"charge for moving\") association with Japanese automakers Mitsubishi , Nissan and Subaru to promote it.

For Nikola Tesla's Colorado Springs laboratory, see Tesla Experimental Station . For the pilot battery swapping station, see Tesla battery station . Tesla Supercharger Tesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg , Germany Established September\u00a024, 2012 ; 12 years ago ( 2012-09-24 ) Type Electric vehicle charging network Locations 7,500 stations Area served Worldwide [ a ] Owner Tesla, Inc Website tesla .com /supercharger The Tesla Supercharger network is an electric vehicle fast charging network built and operated by American vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with five stations in California. As of July\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of about 7,500 Supercharger stations with over 70,000 connectors worldwide. The majority are located in three regions: Asia Pacific (3,000 stations), North America (3,000), and Europe (1,500). Superchargers can currently output as much as 325 kilowatts (kW), with plans to increase output capacity to 500 kW in the future. Usage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. To discourage loitering, fees may be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed. Technology [ edit ] One of the earliest supercharger stations in the United States, located in Lebec, California , has a solar canopy from Tesla Energy . Tesla typically places Superchargers near major highways at locations with amenities for drivers, such as restrooms, restaurants, and shopping. [ 1 ] Some sites also have solar canopies and Megapacks [ 2 ] installed by Tesla Energy to offset energy use and provide drivers with protection from the elements. [ 3 ] When both pairs of this V1 Tesla Supercharger station stalls (A and B) are occupied, they share the available power of up to 120\u00a0kW combined. The original V1 and V2 Tesla supercharging stations were built with a single charger equipment cabinet consisting of four modules shared between two charge posts. When cars are connected to the two posts, and both request maximum power, the station will assign two or three of the four modules to the car plugged in first, and the rest to the later car, limiting the charging output to each car to  50%-50% or 75%-25%. [ 4 ] As an alternative to the Supercharger, in 2015, Tesla briefly implemented a battery swapping station at Harris Ranch in California. The Tesla battery station performed a few swaps and was discontinued shortly afterwards. [ 5 ] \"Urban\" Supercharger posts were introduced in September 2017. These more compact posts have a maximum power delivery of 72 kW but do not share equipment with other posts, allowing the maximum power to be delivered. These more compact posts are primarily deployed in urban areas such as shopping malls, parking lots, and garages. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] V3 stations were introduced in 2019 and could deliver up to 250\u00a0kW. Up to four posts can share a 350\u00a0kW charger equipment cabinet, but up to three cabinets can share power among themselves via a DC bus. In practice, in most cases, this allows each post to deliver maximum power regardless of nearby charging sessions. [ 8 ] The V3 charge posts use a liquid-cooled cable which allows the cable to be thinner and lighter while delivering more power. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Tesla introduced mobile Supercharger stations in 2019 with several urban supercharger posts and a Tesla Megapack energy storage system mounted on a semi-trailer truck . These stations provide temporary stations for nearby events, expand capacity during peak travel seasons, or can be deployed when a station needs to be taken offline. The Megapack can charge up to 100 vehicles before being depleted. [ 11 ] V4 charging posts began to roll out in early 2023 and have longer cables for charging vehicles from other automakers. [ 12 ] The charging posts have a credit card reader potentially allowing non-Tesla owners to charge without downloading the Tesla app, however, as of January 2024 [update] this feature has not been implemented. [ 13 ] The charging posts can support up to 1000\u00a0volts and up to 1000\u00a0amps\u00a0(A). [ 14 ] [ 15 ] As of January 2025, they can deliver up to 325\u00a0kW. [ 16 ] The company plans to increase power delivery to 500\u00a0kW in the future. [ 17 ] On November 14, 2024, Tesla announced the introduction of the V4 Supercharger cabinet, which will start in 2025.\u00a0This version can support charging vehicles with 400 and 800\u00a0V systems and delivering as much as 1.2\u00a0MW. [ 18 ] According to Tesla, in July 2025 the Oto\u010dac Supercharger in Croatia became the first European Supercharger station to be supported by a mobile Megapack. [ 19 ] Version Image Max power Features / Notes V1 90 or 120\u00a0kW Power output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger. V2 120 or 150\u00a0kW Power output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger. Urban 72\u00a0kW Smaller form factor, lower power device for urban installations. V3 250\u00a0kW Equipped with a thinner, lighter cable that uses liquid cooling. Some North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles. V4 325\u00a0kW Equipped with a longer cable for charging non-Tesla vehicles. Some North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles. Connectors and interoperability [ edit ] Connector standards used by Superchargers worldwide: NACS \u00b7 CCS2 \u00b7 GB/T North America [ edit ] In February 2023, Tesla began installing the \"Magic Dock\" at select V3 Supercharger locations. [ 20 ] This dock houses a NACS ( North American Charging System ) to CCS1 ( Combined Charging System ) adapter. When a driver of a NACS-equipped vehicle charges, they simply detach the NACS connector, leaving the adapter locked in place on the charging post. However, when a CCS-equipped vehicle driver reserves a charger via the Tesla mobile app, the Magic Dock unlocks the adapter, making it available for use. The \"magic\" lies in the adapter's captive design\u2014it remains securely locked either in the dock (when a NACS vehicle is charging) or onto the NACS connector (when a CCS vehicle is charging). [ 21 ] Tesla began rolling out V4 Supercharger posts in North America in October 2023, featuring an integrated Magic Dock and a built-in payment terminal . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] These upgrades allowed non-Tesla vehicles to charge without requiring a separate adapter or the Tesla app, and making Tesla eligible for federal, state, and local incentives. This included $7.5\u00a0billion in funding under the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to support the expansion of charging infrastructure. [ 25 ] However, between May 2023 and February 2024, most North American automakers committed to adopting NACS. In September 2024, SAE finalized the standardization of NACS as SAE J3400, effectively eliminating the need for future Tesla Superchargers to support CCS1. As a result, fewer than 100 V3 sites were upgraded with the Magic Dock, and fewer than 50 V4 sites had their Magic Dock adapter activated as of February 2025. [ 26 ] Additionally, only two V4 locations globally, both located outside of North America, currently support the use of the payment terminal. [ 27 ] Europe [ edit ] European V2 charger with dual cables, a Type 2 connector and (plugged in) CCS2 In November 2018, under pressure from European regulators, Tesla announced that it would begin using the CCS2 charging standard, adding the inlets to new vehicles, offering adapters to existing vehicle owners and adding CCS2 connectors to Superchargers. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] China [ edit ] In China, Tesla equips its vehicles and Superchargers with the GB/T charging standard (an abbreviation of \"GuoBiao/TuiJian\", translated as \"recommended national standard\"). [ 31 ] Network [ edit ] The average number of Tesla cars per Supercharger stall was 34 in 2016. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] As of September 2023, Tesla bids building its chargers at about half the cost of its competitors. [ 34 ] Cost estimates per station range from US$100,000 in 2013 [ 35 ] to US$270,000 in 2015, depending on the number of stalls and other circumstances. [ 36 ] In a 2014 filing with the SEC, Tesla reported an \"estimated useful life of 12 years\". [ 37 ] Most car charging occurs at home or work, a situation that Tesla has compared to cell phone charging. [ 38 ] As of 2014 [update] , less than 10% of charging came from Superchargers. [ 39 ] For 2021, Tesla states the network had 99.96% uptime (at least 50% daily capacity) and its power was 100% renewable (through solar power on-site and through purchasing electricity which was matched to renewable generation.) [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In May 2024, it was reported that Tesla had laid off its entire Supercharger team, including its head, Rebecca Tinucci. [ 43 ] Tinucci had made an initial staffing cut of 15\u201320% two weeks prior, as part of company-wide layoffs; after a meeting with Musk in which she proposed a massive network expansion, he demanded more layoffs. When she resisted, stating that further cuts would affect the fundamental business, he dismissed the entire team. [ 44 ] The move was widely expected to slow deployment of stations in the short- to medium-term. [ 45 ] Executives at charging companies have begun to prepare for Tesla to pull out of the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, announced in 2023 with a goal to add 500,000 charging ports over the next five years. Tesla had been awarded contracts to build chargers at 69 of the 501 sites that had received funding to-date. [ 46 ] 10 days later, Musk promised to invest US$500M to expand the network this year, [ 47 ] which would be \"a significant reduction\" from the original plans for 2024, according to former Tesla employees, resulting in an estimated 77% reduction in the rate of charging port deployment. The responsibilities for Supercharger construction and contract management have been taken over by Tesla's energy team. [ 44 ] Billing [ edit ] Usage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. Idle fees can be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed to discourage loitering and, beginning in 2023, some sites have begun to introduce congestion charges to discourage charging at high states of charge when charging is generally slower. [ 48 ] All charges accrued during supercharging are billed to the Tesla account the car is associated with or to the credit card on file for that account. [ 49 ] Unlimited free supercharging for life was offered as a promotion for Model S and Model X cars ordered prior to January 15, 2017, [ 50 ] and between August 2, 2019 [ 51 ] and May 26, 2020. [ 52 ] Unlimited supercharging was also offered during specific periods for vehicles purchased with referral codes. [ 53 ] Additionally, Model S and Model X cars that were ordered between January 15, 2017, and November 2, 2018, received 400 kWh (about 1,000 miles or 1,600\u00a0km) of free Supercharging credits per year. [ 49 ] After the credits are exhausted, supercharging is billed at normal price. [ 54 ] Deployment [ edit ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of 7,000 Supercharger stations with over 65,800 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,800 stations), North America (over 2,800), and Europe (over 1,300).

The first five stations enabled travel between Los Angeles , San Francisco , Lake Tahoe in California and Las Vegas , Nevada. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Soon after, two stations were installed along Interstate 95 in Connecticut and Delaware , enabling trips between Boston, New York and Washington, DC. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] By mid-July 2013, 15 stations were open across the United States. [ 70 ] In October 2013, Tesla announced that the entire West Coast was opened along Interstate 5 and US Route 101 . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] In January 2014, the first coast-to-coast corridor was completed: from Los Angeles to Chicago via South Dakota, then to New York City. [ 73 ] Supercharging stations were available in Canada along Ontario Highway 401 and Quebec Autoroute 20 corridor between Toronto and Montreal by 2014. [ 74 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , the United States (including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico) has over 2,500 Supercharging sites with nearly 30,000 stalls, more than any other nation in the world. Canada has 236 sites and Mexico has 35. [ 26 ] Some stations have many stalls - the Barstow site has 120 stalls, Harris Ranch has 98 stalls, and the Lost Hills, California site has 84 stalls on a relatively small 1.5 MW grid connection with 11 MW onsite solar and 39 MWh battery. [ 75 ] South America [ edit ] In October 2024, Tesla opened its first South American Superchargers in Chile . [ 76 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , the country has two Supercharging sites. [ 26 ] Europe, Middle East and Africa [ edit ] Tesla Supercharger station at a Bundesautobahn 9 rest stop near M\u00fcnchberg , Germany In early 2015, the first European Supercharger was upgraded with a 'solar canopy' (a carport with solar cells on the roof) in K\u00f8ge , Denmark. [ 77 ] According to Tesla the Supercharger had 300\u00a0m 2 (3,230\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of solar cells with a projected annual production of 40 MWh and is, as of 2018, equipped with its own battery bank for temporary storage of excess production. [ 78 ] In April 2016, Kostom\u0142oty became the first charger to open in Poland. [ 79 ] Tesla opened a grid-connected 2-stall Supercharger at N\u00fcrburgring in 2019. [ 80 ] There are a few privately operated Supercharger stations such as the one opened on April 27, 2016, in Zarechye , Russia, with 3 stalls. [ 81 ] In 2015, the European Supercharger network was planned to allow a Model S to drive from the North Cape (near Honningsv\u00e5g ) in Norway to Istanbul , Turkey or Lisbon , Portugal. [ 78 ] As of August 2023 [update] , there are Supercharger stations in or near both Istanbul [ 82 ] and Lisbon. [ 83 ] The map of current and planned sites [ 84 ] includes every European Union country except Malta and Cyprus , and represents all of the countries in the world in the top 10 of electric vehicle adoption rates . [ 85 ] Tesla started testing the charging of non-Tesla cars in the Netherlands in 2021 [ 86 ] and in Norway in early 2022 on 15 large un-congested stations with CCS2. [ 87 ] Tesla opened new stations for non-Tesla cars in several countries in 2022, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. [ 88 ] In the Middle East, Israel , Jordan , Qatar [ 89 ] and the United Arab Emirates have sites. The only nation in Africa to have Supercharger sites is Morocco . [ 26 ] As of July\u00a02024 [update] , the European region has more than 1,350 Supercharging sites across more than 20 countries. [ 26 ] Asia Pacific [ edit ] China is the second largest market for Superchargers after the United States. Tesla operates nearly 2,200 sites in the country with over 12,350 stalls as of January\u00a02025 [update] . Superchargers are also available in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . [ 26 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , other countries with Superchargers include South Korea with 166 sites, Japan with 125, Australia with 108, Taiwan with 107, New Zealand with 28, Thailand with 27, Malaysia with 13, Singapore with 11, Kazakhstan with 2 and the Philippines with 1. [ 26 ] Megacharger [ edit ] See also: Megawatt Charging System In November 2017, Tesla announced a higher-capacity Megacharger as part of the unveiling of a prototype for its Tesla Semi , a semi-trailer truck . These Megachargers provide 400 miles (644\u00a0km) of charge in 30 minutes to the Tesla Semis. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] In November 2021, the first Megacharger was installed at the Gigafactory Nevada where the Tesla Semi is built. [ 92 ] A second Megacharger was permitted for construction at a PepsiCo facility in Modesto, California, in late 2021. [ 93 ] In November 2024, Tesla announced that the new V4 cabinets will have support for charging Tesla semis at up to 1.2MW with a Megacharger. [ 94 ] The megawatt-class cable for the Megacharger supports three times the current density of the V3 Supercharger\u201435 amperes/mm 2 versus approximately 12 for the V3. The cable is also liquid-cooled to support 1000-amp charge rates at 1000 volts in the future.

For Nikola Tesla's Colorado Springs laboratory, see Tesla Experimental Station . For the pilot battery swapping station, see Tesla battery station . Tesla Supercharger Tesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg , Germany Established September\u00a024, 2012 ; 12 years ago ( 2012-09-24 ) Type Electric vehicle charging network Locations 7,500 stations Area served Worldwide [ a ] Owner Tesla, Inc Website tesla .com /supercharger The Tesla Supercharger network is an electric vehicle fast charging network built and operated by American vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with five stations in California. As of July\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of about 7,500 Supercharger stations with over 70,000 connectors worldwide. The majority are located in three regions: Asia Pacific (3,000 stations), North America (3,000), and Europe (1,500). Superchargers can currently output as much as 325 kilowatts (kW), with plans to increase output capacity to 500 kW in the future. Usage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. To discourage loitering, fees may be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed. Technology [ edit ] One of the earliest supercharger stations in the United States, located in Lebec, California , has a solar canopy from Tesla Energy . Tesla typically places Superchargers near major highways at locations with amenities for drivers, such as restrooms, restaurants, and shopping. [ 1 ] Some sites also have solar canopies and Megapacks [ 2 ] installed by Tesla Energy to offset energy use and provide drivers with protection from the elements. [ 3 ] When both pairs of this V1 Tesla Supercharger station stalls (A and B) are occupied, they share the available power of up to 120\u00a0kW combined. The original V1 and V2 Tesla supercharging stations were built with a single charger equipment cabinet consisting of four modules shared between two charge posts. When cars are connected to the two posts, and both request maximum power, the station will assign two or three of the four modules to the car plugged in first, and the rest to the later car, limiting the charging output to each car to  50%-50% or 75%-25%. [ 4 ] As an alternative to the Supercharger, in 2015, Tesla briefly implemented a battery swapping station at Harris Ranch in California. The Tesla battery station performed a few swaps and was discontinued shortly afterwards. [ 5 ] \"Urban\" Supercharger posts were introduced in September 2017. These more compact posts have a maximum power delivery of 72 kW but do not share equipment with other posts, allowing the maximum power to be delivered. These more compact posts are primarily deployed in urban areas such as shopping malls, parking lots, and garages. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] V3 stations were introduced in 2019 and could deliver up to 250\u00a0kW. Up to four posts can share a 350\u00a0kW charger equipment cabinet, but up to three cabinets can share power among themselves via a DC bus. In practice, in most cases, this allows each post to deliver maximum power regardless of nearby charging sessions. [ 8 ] The V3 charge posts use a liquid-cooled cable which allows the cable to be thinner and lighter while delivering more power. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Tesla introduced mobile Supercharger stations in 2019 with several urban supercharger posts and a Tesla Megapack energy storage system mounted on a semi-trailer truck . These stations provide temporary stations for nearby events, expand capacity during peak travel seasons, or can be deployed when a station needs to be taken offline. The Megapack can charge up to 100 vehicles before being depleted. [ 11 ] V4 charging posts began to roll out in early 2023 and have longer cables for charging vehicles from other automakers. [ 12 ] The charging posts have a credit card reader potentially allowing non-Tesla owners to charge without downloading the Tesla app, however, as of January 2024 [update] this feature has not been implemented. [ 13 ] The charging posts can support up to 1000\u00a0volts and up to 1000\u00a0amps\u00a0(A). [ 14 ] [ 15 ] As of January 2025, they can deliver up to 325\u00a0kW. [ 16 ] The company plans to increase power delivery to 500\u00a0kW in the future. [ 17 ] On November 14, 2024, Tesla announced the introduction of the V4 Supercharger cabinet, which will start in 2025.\u00a0This version can support charging vehicles with 400 and 800\u00a0V systems and delivering as much as 1.2\u00a0MW. [ 18 ] According to Tesla, in July 2025 the Oto\u010dac Supercharger in Croatia became the first European Supercharger station to be supported by a mobile Megapack. [ 19 ] Version Image Max power Features / Notes V1 90 or 120\u00a0kW Power output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger. V2 120 or 150\u00a0kW Power output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger. Urban 72\u00a0kW Smaller form factor, lower power device for urban installations. V3 250\u00a0kW Equipped with a thinner, lighter cable that uses liquid cooling. Some North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles. V4 325\u00a0kW Equipped with a longer cable for charging non-Tesla vehicles. Some North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles. Connectors and interoperability [ edit ] Connector standards used by Superchargers worldwide: NACS \u00b7 CCS2 \u00b7 GB/T North America [ edit ] In February 2023, Tesla began installing the \"Magic Dock\" at select V3 Supercharger locations. [ 20 ] This dock houses a NACS ( North American Charging System ) to CCS1 ( Combined Charging System ) adapter. When a driver of a NACS-equipped vehicle charges, they simply detach the NACS connector, leaving the adapter locked in place on the charging post. However, when a CCS-equipped vehicle driver reserves a charger via the Tesla mobile app, the Magic Dock unlocks the adapter, making it available for use. The \"magic\" lies in the adapter's captive design\u2014it remains securely locked either in the dock (when a NACS vehicle is charging) or onto the NACS connector (when a CCS vehicle is charging). [ 21 ] Tesla began rolling out V4 Supercharger posts in North America in October 2023, featuring an integrated Magic Dock and a built-in payment terminal . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] These upgrades allowed non-Tesla vehicles to charge without requiring a separate adapter or the Tesla app, and making Tesla eligible for federal, state, and local incentives. This included $7.5\u00a0billion in funding under the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to support the expansion of charging infrastructure. [ 25 ] However, between May 2023 and February 2024, most North American automakers committed to adopting NACS. In September 2024, SAE finalized the standardization of NACS as SAE J3400, effectively eliminating the need for future Tesla Superchargers to support CCS1. As a result, fewer than 100 V3 sites were upgraded with the Magic Dock, and fewer than 50 V4 sites had their Magic Dock adapter activated as of February 2025. [ 26 ] Additionally, only two V4 locations globally, both located outside of North America, currently support the use of the payment terminal. [ 27 ] Europe [ edit ] European V2 charger with dual cables, a Type 2 connector and (plugged in) CCS2 In November 2018, under pressure from European regulators, Tesla announced that it would begin using the CCS2 charging standard, adding the inlets to new vehicles, offering adapters to existing vehicle owners and adding CCS2 connectors to Superchargers. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] China [ edit ] In China, Tesla equips its vehicles and Superchargers with the GB/T charging standard (an abbreviation of \"GuoBiao/TuiJian\", translated as \"recommended national standard\"). [ 31 ] Network [ edit ] The average number of Tesla cars per Supercharger stall was 34 in 2016. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] As of September 2023, Tesla bids building its chargers at about half the cost of its competitors. [ 34 ] Cost estimates per station range from US$100,000 in 2013 [ 35 ] to US$270,000 in 2015, depending on the number of stalls and other circumstances. [ 36 ] In a 2014 filing with the SEC, Tesla reported an \"estimated useful life of 12 years\". [ 37 ] Most car charging occurs at home or work, a situation that Tesla has compared to cell phone charging. [ 38 ] As of 2014 [update] , less than 10% of charging came from Superchargers. [ 39 ] For 2021, Tesla states the network had 99.96% uptime (at least 50% daily capacity) and its power was 100% renewable (through solar power on-site and through purchasing electricity which was matched to renewable generation.) [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In May 2024, it was reported that Tesla had laid off its entire Supercharger team, including its head, Rebecca Tinucci. [ 43 ] Tinucci had made an initial staffing cut of 15\u201320% two weeks prior, as part of company-wide layoffs; after a meeting with Musk in which she proposed a massive network expansion, he demanded more layoffs. When she resisted, stating that further cuts would affect the fundamental business, he dismissed the entire team. [ 44 ] The move was widely expected to slow deployment of stations in the short- to medium-term. [ 45 ] Executives at charging companies have begun to prepare for Tesla to pull out of the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, announced in 2023 with a goal to add 500,000 charging ports over the next five years. Tesla had been awarded contracts to build chargers at 69 of the 501 sites that had received funding to-date. [ 46 ] 10 days later, Musk promised to invest US$500M to expand the network this year, [ 47 ] which would be \"a significant reduction\" from the original plans for 2024, according to former Tesla employees, resulting in an estimated 77% reduction in the rate of charging port deployment. The responsibilities for Supercharger construction and contract management have been taken over by Tesla's energy team. [ 44 ] Billing [ edit ] Usage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. Idle fees can be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed to discourage loitering and, beginning in 2023, some sites have begun to introduce congestion charges to discourage charging at high states of charge when charging is generally slower. [ 48 ] All charges accrued during supercharging are billed to the Tesla account the car is associated with or to the credit card on file for that account. [ 49 ] Unlimited free supercharging for life was offered as a promotion for Model S and Model X cars ordered prior to January 15, 2017, [ 50 ] and between August 2, 2019 [ 51 ] and May 26, 2020. [ 52 ] Unlimited supercharging was also offered during specific periods for vehicles purchased with referral codes. [ 53 ] Additionally, Model S and Model X cars that were ordered between January 15, 2017, and November 2, 2018, received 400 kWh (about 1,000 miles or 1,600\u00a0km) of free Supercharging credits per year. [ 49 ] After the credits are exhausted, supercharging is billed at normal price. [ 54 ] Deployment [ edit ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of 7,000 Supercharger stations with over 65,800 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,800 stations), North America (over 2,800), and Europe (over 1,300).

The first five stations enabled travel between Los Angeles , San Francisco , Lake Tahoe in California and Las Vegas , Nevada. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Soon after, two stations were installed along Interstate 95 in Connecticut and Delaware , enabling trips between Boston, New York and Washington, DC. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] By mid-July 2013, 15 stations were open across the United States. [ 70 ] In October 2013, Tesla announced that the entire West Coast was opened along Interstate 5 and US Route 101 . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] In January 2014, the first coast-to-coast corridor was completed: from Los Angeles to Chicago via South Dakota, then to New York City. [ 73 ] Supercharging stations were available in Canada along Ontario Highway 401 and Quebec Autoroute 20 corridor between Toronto and Montreal by 2014. [ 74 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , the United States (including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico) has over 2,500 Supercharging sites with nearly 30,000 stalls, more than any other nation in the world. Canada has 236 sites and Mexico has 35. [ 26 ] Some stations have many stalls - the Barstow site has 120 stalls, Harris Ranch has 98 stalls, and the Lost Hills, California site has 84 stalls on a relatively small 1.5 MW grid connection with 11 MW onsite solar and 39 MWh battery. [ 75 ] South America [ edit ] In October 2024, Tesla opened its first South American Superchargers in Chile . [ 76 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , the country has two Supercharging sites. [ 26 ] Europe, Middle East and Africa [ edit ] Tesla Supercharger station at a Bundesautobahn 9 rest stop near M\u00fcnchberg , Germany In early 2015, the first European Supercharger was upgraded with a 'solar canopy' (a carport with solar cells on the roof) in K\u00f8ge , Denmark. [ 77 ] According to Tesla the Supercharger had 300\u00a0m 2 (3,230\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of solar cells with a projected annual production of 40 MWh and is, as of 2018, equipped with its own battery bank for temporary storage of excess production. [ 78 ] In April 2016, Kostom\u0142oty became the first charger to open in Poland. [ 79 ] Tesla opened a grid-connected 2-stall Supercharger at N\u00fcrburgring in 2019. [ 80 ] There are a few privately operated Supercharger stations such as the one opened on April 27, 2016, in Zarechye , Russia, with 3 stalls. [ 81 ] In 2015, the European Supercharger network was planned to allow a Model S to drive from the North Cape (near Honningsv\u00e5g ) in Norway to Istanbul , Turkey or Lisbon , Portugal. [ 78 ] As of August 2023 [update] , there are Supercharger stations in or near both Istanbul [ 82 ] and Lisbon. [ 83 ] The map of current and planned sites [ 84 ] includes every European Union country except Malta and Cyprus , and represents all of the countries in the world in the top 10 of electric vehicle adoption rates . [ 85 ] Tesla started testing the charging of non-Tesla cars in the Netherlands in 2021 [ 86 ] and in Norway in early 2022 on 15 large un-congested stations with CCS2. [ 87 ] Tesla opened new stations for non-Tesla cars in several countries in 2022, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. [ 88 ] In the Middle East, Israel , Jordan , Qatar [ 89 ] and the United Arab Emirates have sites. The only nation in Africa to have Supercharger sites is Morocco . [ 26 ] As of July\u00a02024 [update] , the European region has more than 1,350 Supercharging sites across more than 20 countries. [ 26 ] Asia Pacific [ edit ] China is the second largest market for Superchargers after the United States. Tesla operates nearly 2,200 sites in the country with over 12,350 stalls as of January\u00a02025 [update] . Superchargers are also available in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . [ 26 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , other countries with Superchargers include South Korea with 166 sites, Japan with 125, Australia with 108, Taiwan with 107, New Zealand with 28, Thailand with 27, Malaysia with 13, Singapore with 11, Kazakhstan with 2 and the Philippines with 1. [ 26 ] Megacharger [ edit ] See also: Megawatt Charging System In November 2017, Tesla announced a higher-capacity Megacharger as part of the unveiling of a prototype for its Tesla Semi , a semi-trailer truck . These Megachargers provide 400 miles (644\u00a0km) of charge in 30 minutes to the Tesla Semis. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] In November 2021, the first Megacharger was installed at the Gigafactory Nevada where the Tesla Semi is built. [ 92 ] A second Megacharger was permitted for construction at a PepsiCo facility in Modesto, California, in late 2021. [ 93 ] In November 2024, Tesla announced that the new V4 cabinets will have support for charging Tesla semis at up to 1.2MW with a Megacharger. [ 94 ] The megawatt-class cable for the Megacharger supports three times the current density of the V3 Supercharger\u201435 amperes/mm 2 versus approximately 12 for the V3. The cable is also liquid-cooled to support 1000-amp charge rates at 1000 volts in the future.

For Nikola Tesla's Colorado Springs laboratory, see Tesla Experimental Station . For the pilot battery swapping station, see Tesla battery station . Tesla Supercharger Tesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg , Germany Established September\u00a024, 2012 ; 12 years ago ( 2012-09-24 ) Type Electric vehicle charging network Locations 7,500 stations Area served Worldwide [ a ] Owner Tesla, Inc Website tesla .com /supercharger The Tesla Supercharger network is an electric vehicle fast charging network built and operated by American vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with five stations in California. As of July\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of about 7,500 Supercharger stations with over 70,000 connectors worldwide. The majority are located in three regions: Asia Pacific (3,000 stations), North America (3,000), and Europe (1,500). Superchargers can currently output as much as 325 kilowatts (kW), with plans to increase output capacity to 500 kW in the future. Usage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. To discourage loitering, fees may be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed. Technology [ edit ] One of the earliest supercharger stations in the United States, located in Lebec, California , has a solar canopy from Tesla Energy . Tesla typically places Superchargers near major highways at locations with amenities for drivers, such as restrooms, restaurants, and shopping. [ 1 ] Some sites also have solar canopies and Megapacks [ 2 ] installed by Tesla Energy to offset energy use and provide drivers with protection from the elements. [ 3 ] When both pairs of this V1 Tesla Supercharger station stalls (A and B) are occupied, they share the available power of up to 120\u00a0kW combined. The original V1 and V2 Tesla supercharging stations were built with a single charger equipment cabinet consisting of four modules shared between two charge posts. When cars are connected to the two posts, and both request maximum power, the station will assign two or three of the four modules to the car plugged in first, and the rest to the later car, limiting the charging output to each car to  50%-50% or 75%-25%. [ 4 ] As an alternative to the Supercharger, in 2015, Tesla briefly implemented a battery swapping station at Harris Ranch in California. The Tesla battery station performed a few swaps and was discontinued shortly afterwards. [ 5 ] \"Urban\" Supercharger posts were introduced in September 2017. These more compact posts have a maximum power delivery of 72 kW but do not share equipment with other posts, allowing the maximum power to be delivered. These more compact posts are primarily deployed in urban areas such as shopping malls, parking lots, and garages. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] V3 stations were introduced in 2019 and could deliver up to 250\u00a0kW. Up to four posts can share a 350\u00a0kW charger equipment cabinet, but up to three cabinets can share power among themselves via a DC bus. In practice, in most cases, this allows each post to deliver maximum power regardless of nearby charging sessions. [ 8 ] The V3 charge posts use a liquid-cooled cable which allows the cable to be thinner and lighter while delivering more power. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Tesla introduced mobile Supercharger stations in 2019 with several urban supercharger posts and a Tesla Megapack energy storage system mounted on a semi-trailer truck . These stations provide temporary stations for nearby events, expand capacity during peak travel seasons, or can be deployed when a station needs to be taken offline. The Megapack can charge up to 100 vehicles before being depleted. [ 11 ] V4 charging posts began to roll out in early 2023 and have longer cables for charging vehicles from other automakers. [ 12 ] The charging posts have a credit card reader potentially allowing non-Tesla owners to charge without downloading the Tesla app, however, as of January 2024 [update] this feature has not been implemented. [ 13 ] The charging posts can support up to 1000\u00a0volts and up to 1000\u00a0amps\u00a0(A). [ 14 ] [ 15 ] As of January 2025, they can deliver up to 325\u00a0kW. [ 16 ] The company plans to increase power delivery to 500\u00a0kW in the future. [ 17 ] On November 14, 2024, Tesla announced the introduction of the V4 Supercharger cabinet, which will start in 2025.\u00a0This version can support charging vehicles with 400 and 800\u00a0V systems and delivering as much as 1.2\u00a0MW. [ 18 ] According to Tesla, in July 2025 the Oto\u010dac Supercharger in Croatia became the first European Supercharger station to be supported by a mobile Megapack. [ 19 ] Version Image Max power Features / Notes V1 90 or 120\u00a0kW Power output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger. V2 120 or 150\u00a0kW Power output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger. Urban 72\u00a0kW Smaller form factor, lower power device for urban installations. V3 250\u00a0kW Equipped with a thinner, lighter cable that uses liquid cooling. Some North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles. V4 325\u00a0kW Equipped with a longer cable for charging non-Tesla vehicles. Some North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles. Connectors and interoperability [ edit ] Connector standards used by Superchargers worldwide: NACS \u00b7 CCS2 \u00b7 GB/T North America [ edit ] In February 2023, Tesla began installing the \"Magic Dock\" at select V3 Supercharger locations. [ 20 ] This dock houses a NACS ( North American Charging System ) to CCS1 ( Combined Charging System ) adapter. When a driver of a NACS-equipped vehicle charges, they simply detach the NACS connector, leaving the adapter locked in place on the charging post. However, when a CCS-equipped vehicle driver reserves a charger via the Tesla mobile app, the Magic Dock unlocks the adapter, making it available for use. The \"magic\" lies in the adapter's captive design\u2014it remains securely locked either in the dock (when a NACS vehicle is charging) or onto the NACS connector (when a CCS vehicle is charging). [ 21 ] Tesla began rolling out V4 Supercharger posts in North America in October 2023, featuring an integrated Magic Dock and a built-in payment terminal . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] These upgrades allowed non-Tesla vehicles to charge without requiring a separate adapter or the Tesla app, and making Tesla eligible for federal, state, and local incentives. This included $7.5\u00a0billion in funding under the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to support the expansion of charging infrastructure. [ 25 ] However, between May 2023 and February 2024, most North American automakers committed to adopting NACS. In September 2024, SAE finalized the standardization of NACS as SAE J3400, effectively eliminating the need for future Tesla Superchargers to support CCS1. As a result, fewer than 100 V3 sites were upgraded with the Magic Dock, and fewer than 50 V4 sites had their Magic Dock adapter activated as of February 2025. [ 26 ] Additionally, only two V4 locations globally, both located outside of North America, currently support the use of the payment terminal. [ 27 ] Europe [ edit ] European V2 charger with dual cables, a Type 2 connector and (plugged in) CCS2 In November 2018, under pressure from European regulators, Tesla announced that it would begin using the CCS2 charging standard, adding the inlets to new vehicles, offering adapters to existing vehicle owners and adding CCS2 connectors to Superchargers. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] China [ edit ] In China, Tesla equips its vehicles and Superchargers with the GB/T charging standard (an abbreviation of \"GuoBiao/TuiJian\", translated as \"recommended national standard\"). [ 31 ] Network [ edit ] The average number of Tesla cars per Supercharger stall was 34 in 2016. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] As of September 2023, Tesla bids building its chargers at about half the cost of its competitors. [ 34 ] Cost estimates per station range from US$100,000 in 2013 [ 35 ] to US$270,000 in 2015, depending on the number of stalls and other circumstances. [ 36 ] In a 2014 filing with the SEC, Tesla reported an \"estimated useful life of 12 years\". [ 37 ] Most car charging occurs at home or work, a situation that Tesla has compared to cell phone charging. [ 38 ] As of 2014 [update] , less than 10% of charging came from Superchargers. [ 39 ] For 2021, Tesla states the network had 99.96% uptime (at least 50% daily capacity) and its power was 100% renewable (through solar power on-site and through purchasing electricity which was matched to renewable generation.) [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In May 2024, it was reported that Tesla had laid off its entire Supercharger team, including its head, Rebecca Tinucci. [ 43 ] Tinucci had made an initial staffing cut of 15\u201320% two weeks prior, as part of company-wide layoffs; after a meeting with Musk in which she proposed a massive network expansion, he demanded more layoffs. When she resisted, stating that further cuts would affect the fundamental business, he dismissed the entire team. [ 44 ] The move was widely expected to slow deployment of stations in the short- to medium-term. [ 45 ] Executives at charging companies have begun to prepare for Tesla to pull out of the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, announced in 2023 with a goal to add 500,000 charging ports over the next five years. Tesla had been awarded contracts to build chargers at 69 of the 501 sites that had received funding to-date. [ 46 ] 10 days later, Musk promised to invest US$500M to expand the network this year, [ 47 ] which would be \"a significant reduction\" from the original plans for 2024, according to former Tesla employees, resulting in an estimated 77% reduction in the rate of charging port deployment. The responsibilities for Supercharger construction and contract management have been taken over by Tesla's energy team. [ 44 ] Billing [ edit ] Usage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. Idle fees can be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed to discourage loitering and, beginning in 2023, some sites have begun to introduce congestion charges to discourage charging at high states of charge when charging is generally slower. [ 48 ] All charges accrued during supercharging are billed to the Tesla account the car is associated with or to the credit card on file for that account. [ 49 ] Unlimited free supercharging for life was offered as a promotion for Model S and Model X cars ordered prior to January 15, 2017, [ 50 ] and between August 2, 2019 [ 51 ] and May 26, 2020. [ 52 ] Unlimited supercharging was also offered during specific periods for vehicles purchased with referral codes. [ 53 ] Additionally, Model S and Model X cars that were ordered between January 15, 2017, and November 2, 2018, received 400 kWh (about 1,000 miles or 1,600\u00a0km) of free Supercharging credits per year. [ 49 ] After the credits are exhausted, supercharging is billed at normal price. [ 54 ] Deployment [ edit ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of 7,000 Supercharger stations with over 65,800 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,800 stations), North America (over 2,800), and Europe (over 1,300).

The first five stations enabled travel between Los Angeles , San Francisco , Lake Tahoe in California and Las Vegas , Nevada. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Soon after, two stations were installed along Interstate 95 in Connecticut and Delaware , enabling trips between Boston, New York and Washington, DC. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] By mid-July 2013, 15 stations were open across the United States. [ 70 ] In October 2013, Tesla announced that the entire West Coast was opened along Interstate 5 and US Route 101 . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] In January 2014, the first coast-to-coast corridor was completed: from Los Angeles to Chicago via South Dakota, then to New York City. [ 73 ] Supercharging stations were available in Canada along Ontario Highway 401 and Quebec Autoroute 20 corridor between Toronto and Montreal by 2014. [ 74 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , the United States (including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico) has over 2,500 Supercharging sites with nearly 30,000 stalls, more than any other nation in the world. Canada has 236 sites and Mexico has 35. [ 26 ] Some stations have many stalls - the Barstow site has 120 stalls, Harris Ranch has 98 stalls, and the Lost Hills, California site has 84 stalls on a relatively small 1.5 MW grid connection with 11 MW onsite solar and 39 MWh battery. [ 75 ] South America [ edit ] In October 2024, Tesla opened its first South American Superchargers in Chile . [ 76 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , the country has two Supercharging sites. [ 26 ] Europe, Middle East and Africa [ edit ] Tesla Supercharger station at a Bundesautobahn 9 rest stop near M\u00fcnchberg , Germany In early 2015, the first European Supercharger was upgraded with a 'solar canopy' (a carport with solar cells on the roof) in K\u00f8ge , Denmark. [ 77 ] According to Tesla the Supercharger had 300\u00a0m 2 (3,230\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of solar cells with a projected annual production of 40 MWh and is, as of 2018, equipped with its own battery bank for temporary storage of excess production. [ 78 ] In April 2016, Kostom\u0142oty became the first charger to open in Poland. [ 79 ] Tesla opened a grid-connected 2-stall Supercharger at N\u00fcrburgring in 2019. [ 80 ] There are a few privately operated Supercharger stations such as the one opened on April 27, 2016, in Zarechye , Russia, with 3 stalls. [ 81 ] In 2015, the European Supercharger network was planned to allow a Model S to drive from the North Cape (near Honningsv\u00e5g ) in Norway to Istanbul , Turkey or Lisbon , Portugal. [ 78 ] As of August 2023 [update] , there are Supercharger stations in or near both Istanbul [ 82 ] and Lisbon. [ 83 ] The map of current and planned sites [ 84 ] includes every European Union country except Malta and Cyprus , and represents all of the countries in the world in the top 10 of electric vehicle adoption rates . [ 85 ] Tesla started testing the charging of non-Tesla cars in the Netherlands in 2021 [ 86 ] and in Norway in early 2022 on 15 large un-congested stations with CCS2. [ 87 ] Tesla opened new stations for non-Tesla cars in several countries in 2022, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. [ 88 ] In the Middle East, Israel , Jordan , Qatar [ 89 ] and the United Arab Emirates have sites. The only nation in Africa to have Supercharger sites is Morocco . [ 26 ] As of July\u00a02024 [update] , the European region has more than 1,350 Supercharging sites across more than 20 countries. [ 26 ] Asia Pacific [ edit ] China is the second largest market for Superchargers after the United States. Tesla operates nearly 2,200 sites in the country with over 12,350 stalls as of January\u00a02025 [update] . Superchargers are also available in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . [ 26 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , other countries with Superchargers include South Korea with 166 sites, Japan with 125, Australia with 108, Taiwan with 107, New Zealand with 28, Thailand with 27, Malaysia with 13, Singapore with 11, Kazakhstan with 2 and the Philippines with 1. [ 26 ] Megacharger [ edit ] See also: Megawatt Charging System In November 2017, Tesla announced a higher-capacity Megacharger as part of the unveiling of a prototype for its Tesla Semi , a semi-trailer truck . These Megachargers provide 400 miles (644\u00a0km) of charge in 30 minutes to the Tesla Semis. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] In November 2021, the first Megacharger was installed at the Gigafactory Nevada where the Tesla Semi is built. [ 92 ] A second Megacharger was permitted for construction at a PepsiCo facility in Modesto, California, in late 2021. [ 93 ] In November 2024, Tesla announced that the new V4 cabinets will have support for charging Tesla semis at up to 1.2MW with a Megacharger. [ 94 ] The megawatt-class cable for the Megacharger supports three times the current density of the V3 Supercharger\u201435 amperes/mm 2 versus approximately 12 for the V3. The cable is also liquid-cooled to support 1000-amp charge rates at 1000 volts in the future.

\"Tesla station\" redirects here. For Nikola Tesla's Colorado Springs laboratory, see Tesla Experimental Station . For the pilot battery swapping station, see Tesla battery station . Tesla Supercharger Tesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg , Germany Established September\u00a024, 2012 ; 12 years ago ( 2012-09-24 ) Type Electric vehicle charging network Locations 7,500 stations Area served Worldwide [ a ] Owner Tesla, Inc Website tesla .com /supercharger The Tesla Supercharger network is an electric vehicle fast charging network built and operated by American vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with five stations in California. As of July\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of about 7,500 Supercharger stations with over 70,000 connectors worldwide. The majority are located in three regions: Asia Pacific (3,000 stations), North America (3,000), and Europe (1,500). Superchargers can currently output as much as 325 kilowatts (kW), with plans to increase output capacity to 500 kW in the future. Usage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. To discourage loitering, fees may be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed. Technology [ edit ] One of the earliest supercharger stations in the United States, located in Lebec, California , has a solar canopy from Tesla Energy . Tesla typically places Superchargers near major highways at locations with amenities for drivers, such as restrooms, restaurants, and shopping. [ 1 ] Some sites also have solar canopies and Megapacks [ 2 ] installed by Tesla Energy to offset energy use and provide drivers with protection from the elements. [ 3 ] When both pairs of this V1 Tesla Supercharger station stalls (A and B) are occupied, they share the available power of up to 120\u00a0kW combined. The original V1 and V2 Tesla supercharging stations were built with a single charger equipment cabinet consisting of four modules shared between two charge posts. When cars are connected to the two posts, and both request maximum power, the station will assign two or three of the four modules to the car plugged in first, and the rest to the later car, limiting the charging output to each car to  50%-50% or 75%-25%. [ 4 ] As an alternative to the Supercharger, in 2015, Tesla briefly implemented a battery swapping station at Harris Ranch in California. The Tesla battery station performed a few swaps and was discontinued shortly afterwards. [ 5 ] \"Urban\" Supercharger posts were introduced in September 2017. These more compact posts have a maximum power delivery of 72 kW but do not share equipment with other posts, allowing the maximum power to be delivered. These more compact posts are primarily deployed in urban areas such as shopping malls, parking lots, and garages. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] V3 stations were introduced in 2019 and could deliver up to 250\u00a0kW. Up to four posts can share a 350\u00a0kW charger equipment cabinet, but up to three cabinets can share power among themselves via a DC bus. In practice, in most cases, this allows each post to deliver maximum power regardless of nearby charging sessions. [ 8 ] The V3 charge posts use a liquid-cooled cable which allows the cable to be thinner and lighter while delivering more power. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Tesla introduced mobile Supercharger stations in 2019 with several urban supercharger posts and a Tesla Megapack energy storage system mounted on a semi-trailer truck . These stations provide temporary stations for nearby events, expand capacity during peak travel seasons, or can be deployed when a station needs to be taken offline. The Megapack can charge up to 100 vehicles before being depleted. [ 11 ] V4 charging posts began to roll out in early 2023 and have longer cables for charging vehicles from other automakers. [ 12 ] The charging posts have a credit card reader potentially allowing non-Tesla owners to charge without downloading the Tesla app, however, as of January 2024 [update] this feature has not been implemented. [ 13 ] The charging posts can support up to 1000\u00a0volts and up to 1000\u00a0amps\u00a0(A). [ 14 ] [ 15 ] As of January 2025, they can deliver up to 325\u00a0kW. [ 16 ] The company plans to increase power delivery to 500\u00a0kW in the future. [ 17 ] On November 14, 2024, Tesla announced the introduction of the V4 Supercharger cabinet, which will start in 2025.\u00a0This version can support charging vehicles with 400 and 800\u00a0V systems and delivering as much as 1.2\u00a0MW. [ 18 ] According to Tesla, in July 2025 the Oto\u010dac Supercharger in Croatia became the first European Supercharger station to be supported by a mobile Megapack. [ 19 ] Version Image Max power Features / Notes V1 90 or 120\u00a0kW Power output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger. V2 120 or 150\u00a0kW Power output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger. Urban 72\u00a0kW Smaller form factor, lower power device for urban installations. V3 250\u00a0kW Equipped with a thinner, lighter cable that uses liquid cooling. Some North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles. V4 325\u00a0kW Equipped with a longer cable for charging non-Tesla vehicles. Some North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles. Connectors and interoperability [ edit ] Connector standards used by Superchargers worldwide: NACS \u00b7 CCS2 \u00b7 GB/T North America [ edit ] In February 2023, Tesla began installing the \"Magic Dock\" at select V3 Supercharger locations. [ 20 ] This dock houses a NACS ( North American Charging System ) to CCS1 ( Combined Charging System ) adapter. When a driver of a NACS-equipped vehicle charges, they simply detach the NACS connector, leaving the adapter locked in place on the charging post. However, when a CCS-equipped vehicle driver reserves a charger via the Tesla mobile app, the Magic Dock unlocks the adapter, making it available for use. The \"magic\" lies in the adapter's captive design\u2014it remains securely locked either in the dock (when a NACS vehicle is charging) or onto the NACS connector (when a CCS vehicle is charging). [ 21 ] Tesla began rolling out V4 Supercharger posts in North America in October 2023, featuring an integrated Magic Dock and a built-in payment terminal . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] These upgrades allowed non-Tesla vehicles to charge without requiring a separate adapter or the Tesla app, and making Tesla eligible for federal, state, and local incentives. This included $7.5\u00a0billion in funding under the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to support the expansion of charging infrastructure. [ 25 ] However, between May 2023 and February 2024, most North American automakers committed to adopting NACS. In September 2024, SAE finalized the standardization of NACS as SAE J3400, effectively eliminating the need for future Tesla Superchargers to support CCS1. As a result, fewer than 100 V3 sites were upgraded with the Magic Dock, and fewer than 50 V4 sites had their Magic Dock adapter activated as of February 2025. [ 26 ] Additionally, only two V4 locations globally, both located outside of North America, currently support the use of the payment terminal. [ 27 ] Europe [ edit ] European V2 charger with dual cables, a Type 2 connector and (plugged in) CCS2 In November 2018, under pressure from European regulators, Tesla announced that it would begin using the CCS2 charging standard, adding the inlets to new vehicles, offering adapters to existing vehicle owners and adding CCS2 connectors to Superchargers. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] China [ edit ] In China, Tesla equips its vehicles and Superchargers with the GB/T charging standard (an abbreviation of \"GuoBiao/TuiJian\", translated as \"recommended national standard\"). [ 31 ] Network [ edit ] The average number of Tesla cars per Supercharger stall was 34 in 2016. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] As of September 2023, Tesla bids building its chargers at about half the cost of its competitors. [ 34 ] Cost estimates per station range from US$100,000 in 2013 [ 35 ] to US$270,000 in 2015, depending on the number of stalls and other circumstances. [ 36 ] In a 2014 filing with the SEC, Tesla reported an \"estimated useful life of 12 years\". [ 37 ] Most car charging occurs at home or work, a situation that Tesla has compared to cell phone charging. [ 38 ] As of 2014 [update] , less than 10% of charging came from Superchargers. [ 39 ] For 2021, Tesla states the network had 99.96% uptime (at least 50% daily capacity) and its power was 100% renewable (through solar power on-site and through purchasing electricity which was matched to renewable generation.) [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In May 2024, it was reported that Tesla had laid off its entire Supercharger team, including its head, Rebecca Tinucci. [ 43 ] Tinucci had made an initial staffing cut of 15\u201320% two weeks prior, as part of company-wide layoffs; after a meeting with Musk in which she proposed a massive network expansion, he demanded more layoffs. When she resisted, stating that further cuts would affect the fundamental business, he dismissed the entire team. [ 44 ] The move was widely expected to slow deployment of stations in the short- to medium-term. [ 45 ] Executives at charging companies have begun to prepare for Tesla to pull out of the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, announced in 2023 with a goal to add 500,000 charging ports over the next five years. Tesla had been awarded contracts to build chargers at 69 of the 501 sites that had received funding to-date. [ 46 ] 10 days later, Musk promised to invest US$500M to expand the network this year, [ 47 ] which would be \"a significant reduction\" from the original plans for 2024, according to former Tesla employees, resulting in an estimated 77% reduction in the rate of charging port deployment. The responsibilities for Supercharger construction and contract management have been taken over by Tesla's energy team. [ 44 ] Billing [ edit ] Usage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. Idle fees can be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed to discourage loitering and, beginning in 2023, some sites have begun to introduce congestion charges to discourage charging at high states of charge when charging is generally slower. [ 48 ] All charges accrued during supercharging are billed to the Tesla account the car is associated with or to the credit card on file for that account. [ 49 ] Unlimited free supercharging for life was offered as a promotion for Model S and Model X cars ordered prior to January 15, 2017, [ 50 ] and between August 2, 2019 [ 51 ] and May 26, 2020. [ 52 ] Unlimited supercharging was also offered during specific periods for vehicles purchased with referral codes. [ 53 ] Additionally, Model S and Model X cars that were ordered between January 15, 2017, and November 2, 2018, received 400 kWh (about 1,000 miles or 1,600\u00a0km) of free Supercharging credits per year. [ 49 ] After the credits are exhausted, supercharging is billed at normal price. [ 54 ] Deployment [ edit ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of 7,000 Supercharger stations with over 65,800 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,800 stations), North America (over 2,800), and Europe (over 1,300).

The first five stations enabled travel between Los Angeles , San Francisco , Lake Tahoe in California and Las Vegas , Nevada. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Soon after, two stations were installed along Interstate 95 in Connecticut and Delaware , enabling trips between Boston, New York and Washington, DC. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] By mid-July 2013, 15 stations were open across the United States. [ 70 ] In October 2013, Tesla announced that the entire West Coast was opened along Interstate 5 and US Route 101 . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] In January 2014, the first coast-to-coast corridor was completed: from Los Angeles to Chicago via South Dakota, then to New York City. [ 73 ] Supercharging stations were available in Canada along Ontario Highway 401 and Quebec Autoroute 20 corridor between Toronto and Montreal by 2014. [ 74 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , the United States (including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico) has over 2,500 Supercharging sites with nearly 30,000 stalls, more than any other nation in the world. Canada has 236 sites and Mexico has 35. [ 26 ] Some stations have many stalls - the Barstow site has 120 stalls, Harris Ranch has 98 stalls, and the Lost Hills, California site has 84 stalls on a relatively small 1.5 MW grid connection with 11 MW onsite solar and 39 MWh battery. [ 75 ] South America [ edit ] In October 2024, Tesla opened its first South American Superchargers in Chile . [ 76 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , the country has two Supercharging sites. [ 26 ] Europe, Middle East and Africa [ edit ] Tesla Supercharger station at a Bundesautobahn 9 rest stop near M\u00fcnchberg , Germany In early 2015, the first European Supercharger was upgraded with a 'solar canopy' (a carport with solar cells on the roof) in K\u00f8ge , Denmark. [ 77 ] According to Tesla the Supercharger had 300\u00a0m 2 (3,230\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of solar cells with a projected annual production of 40 MWh and is, as of 2018, equipped with its own battery bank for temporary storage of excess production. [ 78 ] In April 2016, Kostom\u0142oty became the first charger to open in Poland. [ 79 ] Tesla opened a grid-connected 2-stall Supercharger at N\u00fcrburgring in 2019. [ 80 ] There are a few privately operated Supercharger stations such as the one opened on April 27, 2016, in Zarechye , Russia, with 3 stalls. [ 81 ] In 2015, the European Supercharger network was planned to allow a Model S to drive from the North Cape (near Honningsv\u00e5g ) in Norway to Istanbul , Turkey or Lisbon , Portugal. [ 78 ] As of August 2023 [update] , there are Supercharger stations in or near both Istanbul [ 82 ] and Lisbon. [ 83 ] The map of current and planned sites [ 84 ] includes every European Union country except Malta and Cyprus , and represents all of the countries in the world in the top 10 of electric vehicle adoption rates . [ 85 ] Tesla started testing the charging of non-Tesla cars in the Netherlands in 2021 [ 86 ] and in Norway in early 2022 on 15 large un-congested stations with CCS2. [ 87 ] Tesla opened new stations for non-Tesla cars in several countries in 2022, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. [ 88 ] In the Middle East, Israel , Jordan , Qatar [ 89 ] and the United Arab Emirates have sites. The only nation in Africa to have Supercharger sites is Morocco . [ 26 ] As of July\u00a02024 [update] , the European region has more than 1,350 Supercharging sites across more than 20 countries. [ 26 ] Asia Pacific [ edit ] China is the second largest market for Superchargers after the United States. Tesla operates nearly 2,200 sites in the country with over 12,350 stalls as of January\u00a02025 [update] . Superchargers are also available in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . [ 26 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , other countries with Superchargers include South Korea with 166 sites, Japan with 125, Australia with 108, Taiwan with 107, New Zealand with 28, Thailand with 27, Malaysia with 13, Singapore with 11, Kazakhstan with 2 and the Philippines with 1. [ 26 ] Megacharger [ edit ] See also: Megawatt Charging System In November 2017, Tesla announced a higher-capacity Megacharger as part of the unveiling of a prototype for its Tesla Semi , a semi-trailer truck . These Megachargers provide 400 miles (644\u00a0km) of charge in 30 minutes to the Tesla Semis. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] In November 2021, the first Megacharger was installed at the Gigafactory Nevada where the Tesla Semi is built. [ 92 ] A second Megacharger was permitted for construction at a PepsiCo facility in Modesto, California, in late 2021. [ 93 ] In November 2024, Tesla announced that the new V4 cabinets will have support for charging Tesla semis at up to 1.2MW with a Megacharger. [ 94 ] The megawatt-class cable for the Megacharger supports three times the current density of the V3 Supercharger\u201435 amperes/mm 2 versus approximately 12 for the V3. The cable is also liquid-cooled to support 1000-amp charge rates at 1000 volts in the future.

For Nikola Tesla's Colorado Springs laboratory, see Tesla Experimental Station . For the pilot battery swapping station, see Tesla battery station . Tesla Supercharger Tesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg , Germany Established September\u00a024, 2012 ; 12 years ago ( 2012-09-24 ) Type Electric vehicle charging network Locations 7,500 stations Area served Worldwide [ a ] Owner Tesla, Inc Website tesla .com /supercharger The Tesla Supercharger network is an electric vehicle fast charging network built and operated by American vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with five stations in California. As of July\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of about 7,500 Supercharger stations with over 70,000 connectors worldwide. The majority are located in three regions: Asia Pacific (3,000 stations), North America (3,000), and Europe (1,500). Superchargers can currently output as much as 325 kilowatts (kW), with plans to increase output capacity to 500 kW in the future. Usage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. To discourage loitering, fees may be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed. Technology [ edit ] One of the earliest supercharger stations in the United States, located in Lebec, California , has a solar canopy from Tesla Energy . Tesla typically places Superchargers near major highways at locations with amenities for drivers, such as restrooms, restaurants, and shopping. [ 1 ] Some sites also have solar canopies and Megapacks [ 2 ] installed by Tesla Energy to offset energy use and provide drivers with protection from the elements. [ 3 ] When both pairs of this V1 Tesla Supercharger station stalls (A and B) are occupied, they share the available power of up to 120\u00a0kW combined. The original V1 and V2 Tesla supercharging stations were built with a single charger equipment cabinet consisting of four modules shared between two charge posts. When cars are connected to the two posts, and both request maximum power, the station will assign two or three of the four modules to the car plugged in first, and the rest to the later car, limiting the charging output to each car to  50%-50% or 75%-25%. [ 4 ] As an alternative to the Supercharger, in 2015, Tesla briefly implemented a battery swapping station at Harris Ranch in California. The Tesla battery station performed a few swaps and was discontinued shortly afterwards. [ 5 ] \"Urban\" Supercharger posts were introduced in September 2017. These more compact posts have a maximum power delivery of 72 kW but do not share equipment with other posts, allowing the maximum power to be delivered. These more compact posts are primarily deployed in urban areas such as shopping malls, parking lots, and garages. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] V3 stations were introduced in 2019 and could deliver up to 250\u00a0kW. Up to four posts can share a 350\u00a0kW charger equipment cabinet, but up to three cabinets can share power among themselves via a DC bus. In practice, in most cases, this allows each post to deliver maximum power regardless of nearby charging sessions. [ 8 ] The V3 charge posts use a liquid-cooled cable which allows the cable to be thinner and lighter while delivering more power. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Tesla introduced mobile Supercharger stations in 2019 with several urban supercharger posts and a Tesla Megapack energy storage system mounted on a semi-trailer truck . These stations provide temporary stations for nearby events, expand capacity during peak travel seasons, or can be deployed when a station needs to be taken offline. The Megapack can charge up to 100 vehicles before being depleted. [ 11 ] V4 charging posts began to roll out in early 2023 and have longer cables for charging vehicles from other automakers. [ 12 ] The charging posts have a credit card reader potentially allowing non-Tesla owners to charge without downloading the Tesla app, however, as of January 2024 [update] this feature has not been implemented. [ 13 ] The charging posts can support up to 1000\u00a0volts and up to 1000\u00a0amps\u00a0(A). [ 14 ] [ 15 ] As of January 2025, they can deliver up to 325\u00a0kW. [ 16 ] The company plans to increase power delivery to 500\u00a0kW in the future. [ 17 ] On November 14, 2024, Tesla announced the introduction of the V4 Supercharger cabinet, which will start in 2025.\u00a0This version can support charging vehicles with 400 and 800\u00a0V systems and delivering as much as 1.2\u00a0MW. [ 18 ] According to Tesla, in July 2025 the Oto\u010dac Supercharger in Croatia became the first European Supercharger station to be supported by a mobile Megapack. [ 19 ] Version Image Max power Features / Notes V1 90 or 120\u00a0kW Power output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger. V2 120 or 150\u00a0kW Power output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger. Urban 72\u00a0kW Smaller form factor, lower power device for urban installations. V3 250\u00a0kW Equipped with a thinner, lighter cable that uses liquid cooling. Some North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles. V4 325\u00a0kW Equipped with a longer cable for charging non-Tesla vehicles. Some North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles. Connectors and interoperability [ edit ] Connector standards used by Superchargers worldwide: NACS \u00b7 CCS2 \u00b7 GB/T North America [ edit ] In February 2023, Tesla began installing the \"Magic Dock\" at select V3 Supercharger locations. [ 20 ] This dock houses a NACS ( North American Charging System ) to CCS1 ( Combined Charging System ) adapter. When a driver of a NACS-equipped vehicle charges, they simply detach the NACS connector, leaving the adapter locked in place on the charging post. However, when a CCS-equipped vehicle driver reserves a charger via the Tesla mobile app, the Magic Dock unlocks the adapter, making it available for use. The \"magic\" lies in the adapter's captive design\u2014it remains securely locked either in the dock (when a NACS vehicle is charging) or onto the NACS connector (when a CCS vehicle is charging). [ 21 ] Tesla began rolling out V4 Supercharger posts in North America in October 2023, featuring an integrated Magic Dock and a built-in payment terminal . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] These upgrades allowed non-Tesla vehicles to charge without requiring a separate adapter or the Tesla app, and making Tesla eligible for federal, state, and local incentives. This included $7.5\u00a0billion in funding under the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to support the expansion of charging infrastructure. [ 25 ] However, between May 2023 and February 2024, most North American automakers committed to adopting NACS. In September 2024, SAE finalized the standardization of NACS as SAE J3400, effectively eliminating the need for future Tesla Superchargers to support CCS1. As a result, fewer than 100 V3 sites were upgraded with the Magic Dock, and fewer than 50 V4 sites had their Magic Dock adapter activated as of February 2025. [ 26 ] Additionally, only two V4 locations globally, both located outside of North America, currently support the use of the payment terminal. [ 27 ] Europe [ edit ] European V2 charger with dual cables, a Type 2 connector and (plugged in) CCS2 In November 2018, under pressure from European regulators, Tesla announced that it would begin using the CCS2 charging standard, adding the inlets to new vehicles, offering adapters to existing vehicle owners and adding CCS2 connectors to Superchargers. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] China [ edit ] In China, Tesla equips its vehicles and Superchargers with the GB/T charging standard (an abbreviation of \"GuoBiao/TuiJian\", translated as \"recommended national standard\"). [ 31 ] Network [ edit ] The average number of Tesla cars per Supercharger stall was 34 in 2016. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] As of September 2023, Tesla bids building its chargers at about half the cost of its competitors. [ 34 ] Cost estimates per station range from US$100,000 in 2013 [ 35 ] to US$270,000 in 2015, depending on the number of stalls and other circumstances. [ 36 ] In a 2014 filing with the SEC, Tesla reported an \"estimated useful life of 12 years\". [ 37 ] Most car charging occurs at home or work, a situation that Tesla has compared to cell phone charging. [ 38 ] As of 2014 [update] , less than 10% of charging came from Superchargers. [ 39 ] For 2021, Tesla states the network had 99.96% uptime (at least 50% daily capacity) and its power was 100% renewable (through solar power on-site and through purchasing electricity which was matched to renewable generation.) [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In May 2024, it was reported that Tesla had laid off its entire Supercharger team, including its head, Rebecca Tinucci. [ 43 ] Tinucci had made an initial staffing cut of 15\u201320% two weeks prior, as part of company-wide layoffs; after a meeting with Musk in which she proposed a massive network expansion, he demanded more layoffs. When she resisted, stating that further cuts would affect the fundamental business, he dismissed the entire team. [ 44 ] The move was widely expected to slow deployment of stations in the short- to medium-term. [ 45 ] Executives at charging companies have begun to prepare for Tesla to pull out of the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, announced in 2023 with a goal to add 500,000 charging ports over the next five years. Tesla had been awarded contracts to build chargers at 69 of the 501 sites that had received funding to-date. [ 46 ] 10 days later, Musk promised to invest US$500M to expand the network this year, [ 47 ] which would be \"a significant reduction\" from the original plans for 2024, according to former Tesla employees, resulting in an estimated 77% reduction in the rate of charging port deployment. The responsibilities for Supercharger construction and contract management have been taken over by Tesla's energy team. [ 44 ] Billing [ edit ] Usage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. Idle fees can be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed to discourage loitering and, beginning in 2023, some sites have begun to introduce congestion charges to discourage charging at high states of charge when charging is generally slower. [ 48 ] All charges accrued during supercharging are billed to the Tesla account the car is associated with or to the credit card on file for that account. [ 49 ] Unlimited free supercharging for life was offered as a promotion for Model S and Model X cars ordered prior to January 15, 2017, [ 50 ] and between August 2, 2019 [ 51 ] and May 26, 2020. [ 52 ] Unlimited supercharging was also offered during specific periods for vehicles purchased with referral codes. [ 53 ] Additionally, Model S and Model X cars that were ordered between January 15, 2017, and November 2, 2018, received 400 kWh (about 1,000 miles or 1,600\u00a0km) of free Supercharging credits per year. [ 49 ] After the credits are exhausted, supercharging is billed at normal price. [ 54 ] Deployment [ edit ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of 7,000 Supercharger stations with over 65,800 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,800 stations), North America (over 2,800), and Europe (over 1,300).

The first five stations enabled travel between Los Angeles , San Francisco , Lake Tahoe in California and Las Vegas , Nevada. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Soon after, two stations were installed along Interstate 95 in Connecticut and Delaware , enabling trips between Boston, New York and Washington, DC. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] By mid-July 2013, 15 stations were open across the United States. [ 70 ] In October 2013, Tesla announced that the entire West Coast was opened along Interstate 5 and US Route 101 . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] In January 2014, the first coast-to-coast corridor was completed: from Los Angeles to Chicago via South Dakota, then to New York City. [ 73 ] Supercharging stations were available in Canada along Ontario Highway 401 and Quebec Autoroute 20 corridor between Toronto and Montreal by 2014. [ 74 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , the United States (including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico) has over 2,500 Supercharging sites with nearly 30,000 stalls, more than any other nation in the world. Canada has 236 sites and Mexico has 35. [ 26 ] Some stations have many stalls - the Barstow site has 120 stalls, Harris Ranch has 98 stalls, and the Lost Hills, California site has 84 stalls on a relatively small 1.5 MW grid connection with 11 MW onsite solar and 39 MWh battery. [ 75 ] South America [ edit ] In October 2024, Tesla opened its first South American Superchargers in Chile . [ 76 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , the country has two Supercharging sites. [ 26 ] Europe, Middle East and Africa [ edit ] Tesla Supercharger station at a Bundesautobahn 9 rest stop near M\u00fcnchberg , Germany In early 2015, the first European Supercharger was upgraded with a 'solar canopy' (a carport with solar cells on the roof) in K\u00f8ge , Denmark. [ 77 ] According to Tesla the Supercharger had 300\u00a0m 2 (3,230\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of solar cells with a projected annual production of 40 MWh and is, as of 2018, equipped with its own battery bank for temporary storage of excess production. [ 78 ] In April 2016, Kostom\u0142oty became the first charger to open in Poland. [ 79 ] Tesla opened a grid-connected 2-stall Supercharger at N\u00fcrburgring in 2019. [ 80 ] There are a few privately operated Supercharger stations such as the one opened on April 27, 2016, in Zarechye , Russia, with 3 stalls. [ 81 ] In 2015, the European Supercharger network was planned to allow a Model S to drive from the North Cape (near Honningsv\u00e5g ) in Norway to Istanbul , Turkey or Lisbon , Portugal. [ 78 ] As of August 2023 [update] , there are Supercharger stations in or near both Istanbul [ 82 ] and Lisbon. [ 83 ] The map of current and planned sites [ 84 ] includes every European Union country except Malta and Cyprus , and represents all of the countries in the world in the top 10 of electric vehicle adoption rates . [ 85 ] Tesla started testing the charging of non-Tesla cars in the Netherlands in 2021 [ 86 ] and in Norway in early 2022 on 15 large un-congested stations with CCS2. [ 87 ] Tesla opened new stations for non-Tesla cars in several countries in 2022, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. [ 88 ] In the Middle East, Israel , Jordan , Qatar [ 89 ] and the United Arab Emirates have sites. The only nation in Africa to have Supercharger sites is Morocco . [ 26 ] As of July\u00a02024 [update] , the European region has more than 1,350 Supercharging sites across more than 20 countries. [ 26 ] Asia Pacific [ edit ] China is the second largest market for Superchargers after the United States. Tesla operates nearly 2,200 sites in the country with over 12,350 stalls as of January\u00a02025 [update] . Superchargers are also available in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . [ 26 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , other countries with Superchargers include South Korea with 166 sites, Japan with 125, Australia with 108, Taiwan with 107, New Zealand with 28, Thailand with 27, Malaysia with 13, Singapore with 11, Kazakhstan with 2 and the Philippines with 1. [ 26 ] Megacharger [ edit ] See also: Megawatt Charging System In November 2017, Tesla announced a higher-capacity Megacharger as part of the unveiling of a prototype for its Tesla Semi , a semi-trailer truck . These Megachargers provide 400 miles (644\u00a0km) of charge in 30 minutes to the Tesla Semis. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] In November 2021, the first Megacharger was installed at the Gigafactory Nevada where the Tesla Semi is built. [ 92 ] A second Megacharger was permitted for construction at a PepsiCo facility in Modesto, California, in late 2021. [ 93 ] In November 2024, Tesla announced that the new V4 cabinets will have support for charging Tesla semis at up to 1.2MW with a Megacharger. [ 94 ] The megawatt-class cable for the Megacharger supports three times the current density of the V3 Supercharger\u201435 amperes/mm 2 versus approximately 12 for the V3. The cable is also liquid-cooled to support 1000-amp charge rates at 1000 volts in the future.

Tesla Supercharger Tesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg , Germany Established September\u00a024, 2012 ; 12 years ago ( 2012-09-24 ) Type Electric vehicle charging network Locations 7,500 stations Area served Worldwide [ a ] Owner Tesla, Inc Website tesla .com /supercharger The Tesla Supercharger network is an electric vehicle fast charging network built and operated by American vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with five stations in California. As of July\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of about 7,500 Supercharger stations with over 70,000 connectors worldwide. The majority are located in three regions: Asia Pacific (3,000 stations), North America (3,000), and Europe (1,500). Superchargers can currently output as much as 325 kilowatts (kW), with plans to increase output capacity to 500 kW in the future. Usage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. To discourage loitering, fees may be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed. Technology [ edit ] One of the earliest supercharger stations in the United States, located in Lebec, California , has a solar canopy from Tesla Energy . Tesla typically places Superchargers near major highways at locations with amenities for drivers, such as restrooms, restaurants, and shopping. [ 1 ] Some sites also have solar canopies and Megapacks [ 2 ] installed by Tesla Energy to offset energy use and provide drivers with protection from the elements. [ 3 ] When both pairs of this V1 Tesla Supercharger station stalls (A and B) are occupied, they share the available power of up to 120\u00a0kW combined. The original V1 and V2 Tesla supercharging stations were built with a single charger equipment cabinet consisting of four modules shared between two charge posts. When cars are connected to the two posts, and both request maximum power, the station will assign two or three of the four modules to the car plugged in first, and the rest to the later car, limiting the charging output to each car to  50%-50% or 75%-25%. [ 4 ] As an alternative to the Supercharger, in 2015, Tesla briefly implemented a battery swapping station at Harris Ranch in California. The Tesla battery station performed a few swaps and was discontinued shortly afterwards. [ 5 ] \"Urban\" Supercharger posts were introduced in September 2017. These more compact posts have a maximum power delivery of 72 kW but do not share equipment with other posts, allowing the maximum power to be delivered. These more compact posts are primarily deployed in urban areas such as shopping malls, parking lots, and garages. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] V3 stations were introduced in 2019 and could deliver up to 250\u00a0kW. Up to four posts can share a 350\u00a0kW charger equipment cabinet, but up to three cabinets can share power among themselves via a DC bus. In practice, in most cases, this allows each post to deliver maximum power regardless of nearby charging sessions. [ 8 ] The V3 charge posts use a liquid-cooled cable which allows the cable to be thinner and lighter while delivering more power. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Tesla introduced mobile Supercharger stations in 2019 with several urban supercharger posts and a Tesla Megapack energy storage system mounted on a semi-trailer truck . These stations provide temporary stations for nearby events, expand capacity during peak travel seasons, or can be deployed when a station needs to be taken offline. The Megapack can charge up to 100 vehicles before being depleted. [ 11 ] V4 charging posts began to roll out in early 2023 and have longer cables for charging vehicles from other automakers. [ 12 ] The charging posts have a credit card reader potentially allowing non-Tesla owners to charge without downloading the Tesla app, however, as of January 2024 [update] this feature has not been implemented. [ 13 ] The charging posts can support up to 1000\u00a0volts and up to 1000\u00a0amps\u00a0(A). [ 14 ] [ 15 ] As of January 2025, they can deliver up to 325\u00a0kW. [ 16 ] The company plans to increase power delivery to 500\u00a0kW in the future. [ 17 ] On November 14, 2024, Tesla announced the introduction of the V4 Supercharger cabinet, which will start in 2025.\u00a0This version can support charging vehicles with 400 and 800\u00a0V systems and delivering as much as 1.2\u00a0MW. [ 18 ] According to Tesla, in July 2025 the Oto\u010dac Supercharger in Croatia became the first European Supercharger station to be supported by a mobile Megapack. [ 19 ] Version Image Max power Features / Notes V1 90 or 120\u00a0kW Power output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger. V2 120 or 150\u00a0kW Power output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger. Urban 72\u00a0kW Smaller form factor, lower power device for urban installations. V3 250\u00a0kW Equipped with a thinner, lighter cable that uses liquid cooling. Some North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles. V4 325\u00a0kW Equipped with a longer cable for charging non-Tesla vehicles. Some North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles. Connectors and interoperability [ edit ] Connector standards used by Superchargers worldwide: NACS \u00b7 CCS2 \u00b7 GB/T North America [ edit ] In February 2023, Tesla began installing the \"Magic Dock\" at select V3 Supercharger locations. [ 20 ] This dock houses a NACS ( North American Charging System ) to CCS1 ( Combined Charging System ) adapter. When a driver of a NACS-equipped vehicle charges, they simply detach the NACS connector, leaving the adapter locked in place on the charging post. However, when a CCS-equipped vehicle driver reserves a charger via the Tesla mobile app, the Magic Dock unlocks the adapter, making it available for use. The \"magic\" lies in the adapter's captive design\u2014it remains securely locked either in the dock (when a NACS vehicle is charging) or onto the NACS connector (when a CCS vehicle is charging). [ 21 ] Tesla began rolling out V4 Supercharger posts in North America in October 2023, featuring an integrated Magic Dock and a built-in payment terminal . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] These upgrades allowed non-Tesla vehicles to charge without requiring a separate adapter or the Tesla app, and making Tesla eligible for federal, state, and local incentives. This included $7.5\u00a0billion in funding under the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to support the expansion of charging infrastructure. [ 25 ] However, between May 2023 and February 2024, most North American automakers committed to adopting NACS. In September 2024, SAE finalized the standardization of NACS as SAE J3400, effectively eliminating the need for future Tesla Superchargers to support CCS1. As a result, fewer than 100 V3 sites were upgraded with the Magic Dock, and fewer than 50 V4 sites had their Magic Dock adapter activated as of February 2025. [ 26 ] Additionally, only two V4 locations globally, both located outside of North America, currently support the use of the payment terminal. [ 27 ] Europe [ edit ] European V2 charger with dual cables, a Type 2 connector and (plugged in) CCS2 In November 2018, under pressure from European regulators, Tesla announced that it would begin using the CCS2 charging standard, adding the inlets to new vehicles, offering adapters to existing vehicle owners and adding CCS2 connectors to Superchargers. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] China [ edit ] In China, Tesla equips its vehicles and Superchargers with the GB/T charging standard (an abbreviation of \"GuoBiao/TuiJian\", translated as \"recommended national standard\"). [ 31 ] Network [ edit ] The average number of Tesla cars per Supercharger stall was 34 in 2016. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] As of September 2023, Tesla bids building its chargers at about half the cost of its competitors. [ 34 ] Cost estimates per station range from US$100,000 in 2013 [ 35 ] to US$270,000 in 2015, depending on the number of stalls and other circumstances. [ 36 ] In a 2014 filing with the SEC, Tesla reported an \"estimated useful life of 12 years\". [ 37 ] Most car charging occurs at home or work, a situation that Tesla has compared to cell phone charging. [ 38 ] As of 2014 [update] , less than 10% of charging came from Superchargers. [ 39 ] For 2021, Tesla states the network had 99.96% uptime (at least 50% daily capacity) and its power was 100% renewable (through solar power on-site and through purchasing electricity which was matched to renewable generation.) [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In May 2024, it was reported that Tesla had laid off its entire Supercharger team, including its head, Rebecca Tinucci. [ 43 ] Tinucci had made an initial staffing cut of 15\u201320% two weeks prior, as part of company-wide layoffs; after a meeting with Musk in which she proposed a massive network expansion, he demanded more layoffs. When she resisted, stating that further cuts would affect the fundamental business, he dismissed the entire team. [ 44 ] The move was widely expected to slow deployment of stations in the short- to medium-term. [ 45 ] Executives at charging companies have begun to prepare for Tesla to pull out of the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, announced in 2023 with a goal to add 500,000 charging ports over the next five years. Tesla had been awarded contracts to build chargers at 69 of the 501 sites that had received funding to-date. [ 46 ] 10 days later, Musk promised to invest US$500M to expand the network this year, [ 47 ] which would be \"a significant reduction\" from the original plans for 2024, according to former Tesla employees, resulting in an estimated 77% reduction in the rate of charging port deployment. The responsibilities for Supercharger construction and contract management have been taken over by Tesla's energy team. [ 44 ] Billing [ edit ] Usage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. Idle fees can be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed to discourage loitering and, beginning in 2023, some sites have begun to introduce congestion charges to discourage charging at high states of charge when charging is generally slower. [ 48 ] All charges accrued during supercharging are billed to the Tesla account the car is associated with or to the credit card on file for that account. [ 49 ] Unlimited free supercharging for life was offered as a promotion for Model S and Model X cars ordered prior to January 15, 2017, [ 50 ] and between August 2, 2019 [ 51 ] and May 26, 2020. [ 52 ] Unlimited supercharging was also offered during specific periods for vehicles purchased with referral codes. [ 53 ] Additionally, Model S and Model X cars that were ordered between January 15, 2017, and November 2, 2018, received 400 kWh (about 1,000 miles or 1,600\u00a0km) of free Supercharging credits per year. [ 49 ] After the credits are exhausted, supercharging is billed at normal price. [ 54 ] Deployment [ edit ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of 7,000 Supercharger stations with over 65,800 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,800 stations), North America (over 2,800), and Europe (over 1,300).

The first five stations enabled travel between Los Angeles , San Francisco , Lake Tahoe in California and Las Vegas , Nevada. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Soon after, two stations were installed along Interstate 95 in Connecticut and Delaware , enabling trips between Boston, New York and Washington, DC. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] By mid-July 2013, 15 stations were open across the United States. [ 70 ] In October 2013, Tesla announced that the entire West Coast was opened along Interstate 5 and US Route 101 . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] In January 2014, the first coast-to-coast corridor was completed: from Los Angeles to Chicago via South Dakota, then to New York City. [ 73 ] Supercharging stations were available in Canada along Ontario Highway 401 and Quebec Autoroute 20 corridor between Toronto and Montreal by 2014. [ 74 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , the United States (including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico) has over 2,500 Supercharging sites with nearly 30,000 stalls, more than any other nation in the world. Canada has 236 sites and Mexico has 35. [ 26 ] Some stations have many stalls - the Barstow site has 120 stalls, Harris Ranch has 98 stalls, and the Lost Hills, California site has 84 stalls on a relatively small 1.5 MW grid connection with 11 MW onsite solar and 39 MWh battery. [ 75 ] South America [ edit ] In October 2024, Tesla opened its first South American Superchargers in Chile . [ 76 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , the country has two Supercharging sites. [ 26 ] Europe, Middle East and Africa [ edit ] Tesla Supercharger station at a Bundesautobahn 9 rest stop near M\u00fcnchberg , Germany In early 2015, the first European Supercharger was upgraded with a 'solar canopy' (a carport with solar cells on the roof) in K\u00f8ge , Denmark. [ 77 ] According to Tesla the Supercharger had 300\u00a0m 2 (3,230\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of solar cells with a projected annual production of 40 MWh and is, as of 2018, equipped with its own battery bank for temporary storage of excess production. [ 78 ] In April 2016, Kostom\u0142oty became the first charger to open in Poland. [ 79 ] Tesla opened a grid-connected 2-stall Supercharger at N\u00fcrburgring in 2019. [ 80 ] There are a few privately operated Supercharger stations such as the one opened on April 27, 2016, in Zarechye , Russia, with 3 stalls. [ 81 ] In 2015, the European Supercharger network was planned to allow a Model S to drive from the North Cape (near Honningsv\u00e5g ) in Norway to Istanbul , Turkey or Lisbon , Portugal. [ 78 ] As of August 2023 [update] , there are Supercharger stations in or near both Istanbul [ 82 ] and Lisbon. [ 83 ] The map of current and planned sites [ 84 ] includes every European Union country except Malta and Cyprus , and represents all of the countries in the world in the top 10 of electric vehicle adoption rates . [ 85 ] Tesla started testing the charging of non-Tesla cars in the Netherlands in 2021 [ 86 ] and in Norway in early 2022 on 15 large un-congested stations with CCS2. [ 87 ] Tesla opened new stations for non-Tesla cars in several countries in 2022, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. [ 88 ] In the Middle East, Israel , Jordan , Qatar [ 89 ] and the United Arab Emirates have sites. The only nation in Africa to have Supercharger sites is Morocco . [ 26 ] As of July\u00a02024 [update] , the European region has more than 1,350 Supercharging sites across more than 20 countries. [ 26 ] Asia Pacific [ edit ] China is the second largest market for Superchargers after the United States. Tesla operates nearly 2,200 sites in the country with over 12,350 stalls as of January\u00a02025 [update] . Superchargers are also available in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . [ 26 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , other countries with Superchargers include South Korea with 166 sites, Japan with 125, Australia with 108, Taiwan with 107, New Zealand with 28, Thailand with 27, Malaysia with 13, Singapore with 11, Kazakhstan with 2 and the Philippines with 1. [ 26 ] Megacharger [ edit ] See also: Megawatt Charging System In November 2017, Tesla announced a higher-capacity Megacharger as part of the unveiling of a prototype for its Tesla Semi , a semi-trailer truck . These Megachargers provide 400 miles (644\u00a0km) of charge in 30 minutes to the Tesla Semis. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] In November 2021, the first Megacharger was installed at the Gigafactory Nevada where the Tesla Semi is built. [ 92 ] A second Megacharger was permitted for construction at a PepsiCo facility in Modesto, California, in late 2021. [ 93 ] In November 2024, Tesla announced that the new V4 cabinets will have support for charging Tesla semis at up to 1.2MW with a Megacharger. [ 94 ] The megawatt-class cable for the Megacharger supports three times the current density of the V3 Supercharger\u201435 amperes/mm 2 versus approximately 12 for the V3. The cable is also liquid-cooled to support 1000-amp charge rates at 1000 volts in the future.

For Nikola Tesla's Colorado Springs laboratory, see Tesla Experimental Station . For the pilot battery swapping station, see Tesla battery station .\n\nTesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg , Germany\n7,500 stations\n7,500 stations\nArea served\nThe Tesla Supercharger network is an electric vehicle fast charging network built and operated by American vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc.\nThe Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with five stations in California. As of July\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of about 7,500 Supercharger stations with over 70,000 connectors worldwide. The majority are located in three regions: Asia Pacific (3,000 stations), North America (3,000), and Europe (1,500). Superchargers can currently output as much as 325 kilowatts (kW), with plans to increase output capacity to 500 kW in the future.\nUsage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. To discourage loitering, fees may be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed.\nTechnology [ edit ]\nTechnology\nTesla typically places Superchargers near major highways at locations with amenities for drivers, such as restrooms, restaurants, and shopping. [ 1 ] Some sites also have solar canopies and Megapacks [ 2 ] installed by Tesla Energy to offset energy use and provide drivers with protection from the elements. [ 3 ]\nThe original V1 and V2 Tesla supercharging stations were built with a single charger equipment cabinet consisting of four modules shared between two charge posts. When cars are connected to the two posts, and both request maximum power, the station will assign two or three of the four modules to the car plugged in first, and the rest to the later car, limiting the charging output to each car to  50%-50% or 75%-25%. [ 4 ]\nAs an alternative to the Supercharger, in 2015, Tesla briefly implemented a battery swapping station at Harris Ranch in California. The Tesla battery station performed a few swaps and was discontinued shortly afterwards. [ 5 ]\n\"Urban\" Supercharger posts were introduced in September 2017. These more compact posts have a maximum power delivery of 72 kW but do not share equipment with other posts, allowing the maximum power to be delivered. These more compact posts are primarily deployed in urban areas such as shopping malls, parking lots, and garages. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]\nV3 stations were introduced in 2019 and could deliver up to 250\u00a0kW. Up to four posts can share a 350\u00a0kW charger equipment cabinet, but up to three cabinets can share power among themselves via a DC bus. In practice, in most cases, this allows each post to deliver maximum power regardless of nearby charging sessions. [ 8 ] The V3 charge posts use a liquid-cooled cable which allows the cable to be thinner and lighter while delivering more power. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]\nTesla introduced mobile Supercharger stations in 2019 with several urban supercharger posts and a Tesla Megapack energy storage system mounted on a semi-trailer truck . These stations provide temporary stations for nearby events, expand capacity during peak travel seasons, or can be deployed when a station needs to be taken offline. The Megapack can charge up to 100 vehicles before being depleted. [ 11 ]\nV4 charging posts began to roll out in early 2023 and have longer cables for charging vehicles from other automakers. [ 12 ] The charging posts have a credit card reader potentially allowing non-Tesla owners to charge without downloading the Tesla app, however, as of January 2024 [update] this feature has not been implemented. [ 13 ] The charging posts can support up to 1000\u00a0volts and up to 1000\u00a0amps\u00a0(A). [ 14 ] [ 15 ] As of January 2025, they can deliver up to 325\u00a0kW. [ 16 ] The company plans to increase power delivery to 500\u00a0kW in the future. [ 17 ]\nOn November 14, 2024, Tesla announced the introduction of the V4 Supercharger cabinet, which will start in 2025.\u00a0This version can support charging vehicles with 400 and 800\u00a0V systems and delivering as much as 1.2\u00a0MW. [ 18 ]\nAccording to Tesla, in July 2025 the Oto\u010dac Supercharger in Croatia became the first European Supercharger station to be supported by a mobile Megapack.

[ 20 ] This dock houses a NACS ( North American Charging System ) to CCS1 ( Combined Charging System ) adapter. When a driver of a NACS-equipped vehicle charges, they simply detach the NACS connector, leaving the adapter locked in place on the charging post. However, when a CCS-equipped vehicle driver reserves a charger via the Tesla mobile app, the Magic Dock unlocks the adapter, making it available for use. The \"magic\" lies in the adapter's captive design\u2014it remains securely locked either in the dock (when a NACS vehicle is charging) or onto the NACS connector (when a CCS vehicle is charging). [ 21 ]\nTesla began rolling out V4 Supercharger posts in North America in October 2023, featuring an integrated Magic Dock and a built-in payment terminal . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] These upgrades allowed non-Tesla vehicles to charge without requiring a separate adapter or the Tesla app, and making Tesla eligible for federal, state, and local incentives. This included $7.5\u00a0billion in funding under the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to support the expansion of charging infrastructure. [ 25 ]\nHowever, between May 2023 and February 2024, most North American automakers committed to adopting NACS. In September 2024, SAE finalized the standardization of NACS as SAE J3400, effectively eliminating the need for future Tesla Superchargers to support CCS1. As a result, fewer than 100 V3 sites were upgraded with the Magic Dock, and fewer than 50 V4 sites had their Magic Dock adapter activated as of February 2025. [ 26 ] Additionally, only two V4 locations globally, both located outside of North America, currently support the use of the payment terminal. [ 27 ]\nEurope [ edit ]\nIn November 2018, under pressure from European regulators, Tesla announced that it would begin using the CCS2 charging standard, adding the inlets to new vehicles, offering adapters to existing vehicle owners and adding CCS2 connectors to Superchargers. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]\nChina [ edit ]\nIn China, Tesla equips its vehicles and Superchargers with the GB/T charging standard (an abbreviation of \"GuoBiao/TuiJian\", translated as \"recommended national standard\"). [ 31 ]\nNetwork [ edit ]\nNetwork\nThe average number of Tesla cars per Supercharger stall was 34 in 2016. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] As of September 2023, Tesla bids building its chargers at about half the cost of its competitors. [ 34 ] Cost estimates per station range from US$100,000 in 2013 [ 35 ] to US$270,000 in 2015, depending on the number of stalls and other circumstances. [ 36 ] In a 2014 filing with the SEC, Tesla reported an \"estimated useful life of 12 years\". [ 37 ]\nMost car charging occurs at home or work, a situation that Tesla has compared to cell phone charging. [ 38 ] As of 2014 [update] , less than 10% of charging came from Superchargers. [ 39 ]\nFor 2021, Tesla states the network had 99.96% uptime (at least 50% daily capacity) and its power was 100% renewable (through solar power on-site and through purchasing electricity which was matched to renewable generation.) [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ]\nIn May 2024, it was reported that Tesla had laid off its entire Supercharger team, including its head, Rebecca Tinucci. [ 43 ] Tinucci had made an initial staffing cut of 15\u201320% two weeks prior, as part of company-wide layoffs; after a meeting with Musk in which she proposed a massive network expansion, he demanded more layoffs. When she resisted, stating that further cuts would affect the fundamental business, he dismissed the entire team. [ 44 ] The move was widely expected to slow deployment of stations in the short- to medium-term. [ 45 ] Executives at charging companies have begun to prepare for Tesla to pull out of the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, announced in 2023 with a goal to add 500,000 charging ports over the next five years. Tesla had been awarded contracts to build chargers at 69 of the 501 sites that had received funding to-date. [ 46 ] 10 days later, Musk promised to invest US$500M to expand the network this year, [ 47 ] which would be \"a significant reduction\" from the original plans for 2024, according to former Tesla employees, resulting in an estimated 77% reduction in the rate of charging port deployment. The responsibilities for Supercharger construction and contract management have been taken over by Tesla's energy team. [ 44 ]\nBilling [ edit ]\nBilling\nUsage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. Idle fees can be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed to discourage loitering and, beginning in 2023, some sites have begun to introduce congestion charges to discourage charging at high states of charge when charging is generally slower. [ 48 ] All charges accrued during supercharging are billed to the Tesla account the car is associated with or to the credit card on file for that account. [ 49 ]\nUnlimited free supercharging for life was offered as a promotion for Model S and Model X cars ordered prior to January 15, 2017, [ 50 ] and between August 2, 2019 [ 51 ] and May 26, 2020. [ 52 ] Unlimited supercharging was also offered during specific periods for vehicles purchased with referral codes. [ 53 ]\nAdditionally, Model S and Model X cars that were ordered between January 15, 2017, and November 2, 2018, received 400 kWh (about 1,000 miles or 1,600\u00a0km) of free Supercharging credits per year. [ 49 ] After the credits are exhausted, supercharging is billed at normal price. [ 54 ]\nDeployment [ edit ]\nDeployment\nAs of January\u00a02025 [update] , Tesla operates a network of 7,000 Supercharger stations with over 65,800 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,800 stations), North America (over 2,800), and Europe (over 1,300). [ 26 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth America [ edit ]\nNorth America\nThe first Superchargers in the world opened in 2012 in the United States , with the company initially focusing on high-traffic corridors. The first five stations enabled travel between Los Angeles , San Francisco , Lake Tahoe in California and Las Vegas , Nevada. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Soon after, two stations were installed along Interstate 95 in Connecticut and Delaware , enabling trips between Boston, New York and Washington, DC. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] By mid-July 2013, 15 stations were open across the United States. [ 70 ] In October 2013, Tesla announced that the entire West Coast was opened along Interstate 5 and US Route 101 . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] In January 2014, the first coast-to-coast corridor was completed: from Los Angeles to Chicago via South Dakota, then to New York City. [ 73 ]\nSupercharging stations were available in Canada along Ontario Highway 401 and Quebec Autoroute 20 corridor between Toronto and Montreal by 2014. [ 74 ]\nAs of January\u00a02025 [update] , the United States (including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico) has over 2,500 Supercharging sites with nearly 30,000 stalls, more than any other nation in the world. Canada has 236 sites and Mexico has 35. [ 26 ] Some stations have many stalls - the Barstow site has 120 stalls, Harris Ranch has 98 stalls, and the Lost Hills, California site has 84 stalls on a relatively small 1.5 MW grid connection with 11 MW onsite solar and 39 MWh battery. [ 75 ]\nSouth America [ edit ]\nSouth America\nIn October 2024, Tesla opened its first South American Superchargers in Chile . [ 76 ] As of January\u00a02025 [update] , the country has two Supercharging sites. [ 26 ]\nEurope, Middle East and Africa [ edit ]\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\nIn early 2015, the first European Supercharger was upgraded with a 'solar canopy' (a carport with solar cells on the roof) in K\u00f8ge , Denmark. [ 77 ] According to Tesla the Supercharger had 300\u00a0m 2 (3,230\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of solar cells with a projected annual production of 40 MWh and is, as of 2018, equipped with its own battery bank for temporary storage of excess production. [ 78 ] In April 2016, Kostom\u0142oty became the first charger to open in Poland. [ 79 ] Tesla opened a grid-connected 2-stall Supercharger at N\u00fcrburgring in 2019. [ 80 ] There are a few privately operated Supercharger stations such as the one opened on April 27, 2016, in Zarechye , Russia, with 3 stalls. [ 81 ]\nIn 2015, the European Supercharger network was planned to allow a Model S to drive from the North Cape (near Honningsv\u00e5g ) in Norway to Istanbul , Turkey or Lisbon , Portugal. [ 78 ] As of August 2023 [update] , there are Supercharger stations in or near both Istanbul [ 82 ] and Lisbon. [ 83 ] The map of current and planned sites [ 84 ] includes every European Union country except Malta and Cyprus , and represents all of the countries in the world in the top 10 of electric vehicle adoption rates . [ 85 ]\nTesla started testing the charging of non-Tesla cars in the Netherlands in 2021 [ 86 ] and in Norway in early 2022 on 15 large un-congested stations with CCS2. [ 87 ] Tesla opened new stations for non-Tesla cars in several countries in 2022, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. [ 88 ]\nIn the Middle East, Israel , Jordan , Qatar [ 89 ] and the United Arab Emirates have sites. The only nation in Africa to have Supercharger sites is Morocco . [ 26 ]\nAs of July\u00a02024 [update] , the European region has more than 1,350 Supercharging sites across more than 20 countries. [ 26 ]\nAsia Pacific [ edit ]\nAsia Pacific\nChina is the second largest market for Superchargers after the United States. Tesla operates nearly 2,200 sites in the country with over 12,350 stalls as of January\u00a02025 [update] . Superchargers are also available in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . [ 26 ]\nAs of January\u00a02025 [update] , other countries with Superchargers include South Korea with 166 sites, Japan with 125, Australia with 108, Taiwan with 107, New Zealand with 28, Thailand with 27, Malaysia with 13, Singapore with 11, Kazakhstan with 2 and the Philippines with 1. [ 26 ]\nMegacharger [ edit ]\nMegacharger\nSee also: Megawatt Charging System\nIn November 2017, Tesla announced a higher-capacity Megacharger as part of the unveiling of a prototype for its Tesla Semi , a semi-trailer truck . These Megachargers provide 400 miles (644\u00a0km) of charge in 30 minutes to the Tesla Semis. [ 90 ] [ 91 ]\nIn November 2021, the first Megacharger was installed at the Gigafactory Nevada where the Tesla Semi is built. [ 92 ] A second Megacharger was permitted for construction at a PepsiCo facility in Modesto, California, in late 2021. [ 93 ]\nIn November 2024, Tesla announced that the new V4 cabinets will have support for charging Tesla semis at up to 1.2MW with a Megacharger. [ 94 ]\nThe megawatt-class cable for the Megacharger supports three times the current density of the V3 Supercharger\u201435 amperes/mm 2 versus approximately 12 for the V3. The cable is also liquid-cooled to support 1000-amp charge rates at 1000 volts in the future.
