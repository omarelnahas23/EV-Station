For the company, see ChargePoint.\n\n\nCharging stations for electric vehicles:\nTop-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city, Japan.\nTop-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point.\nBottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas.\nBottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009).\nA charging station, also known as a charge point, chargepoint, or electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles, electric trucks, electric buses, neighborhood electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrid vehicles).\nThere are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power.\nCharging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards.\n\n\nPublic charging stations[edit]\nFred Meyer parking area\nPublic charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.\n\nStandards[edit]\nMultiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012.[1]\n\nNomenclature[edit]\nCharging station and vehicle terminology\nIn 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms:[2]\n\nSocket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle\nPlug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached.\nCable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle\nConnector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet\nVehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power\nThe terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\".[3]\nTesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE.[4]\n\nVoltage and power[edit]\nEarly standards[edit]\n\nNEC(1999) levels[5]:\u200a9\u200a\n\n\nMethod\nMaximum supply\n\n\nCurrent (A)\nVoltage (V)\nPower (kW)\n\n\nLevel 1 (1-phase AC)\n\n12\n120\n1.44\n\n\n16\n120\n1.92\n\n\n24\n120\n2.88\n\n\nLevel 2 (1-phase AC)\n\n32\n208/240\n7.68\n\n\nLevel 3 (3-phase AC)\n\n400\n480\n332.6\n\nThe National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States;[6] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook.[5]:\u200a9\u200a\nUnder the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5-20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16\u00a0amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A.[5]:\u200a9\u200a\nLevel 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit.[5]:\u200a9\u200a For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle (Magne Charge) or a conductive connector (Avcon).[5]:\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18\u200a\nLevel 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers.[5]:\u200a9\u200a\n\nSAE[edit]\n\nSAE J1772(2017) levels[7]\n\n\nMethod\nMaximum supply\n\n\nCurrent (A)\nVoltage (V)\nPower (kW)\n\n\nAC Level 1\n\n12\n120\n1.44\n\n\n16\n120\n1.92\n\n\nAC Level 2\n\n80\n208\u2013240\n19.2\n\n\nDC Level 1\n\n80\n50\u20131000\n80\n\n\nDC Level 2\n\n400\n50\u20131000\n400\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772, initially developed in 2001.[8] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power.\n\nAlternating current (AC)[edit]\nAC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply.[8]\n\nAC Level 1: Connects directly to a standard 120\u00a0V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316\u00a0A (0.7\u20131.92\u00a0kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit.\nAC Level 2: Uses 240\u00a0V (single phase) or 208\u00a0V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80\u00a0A (1.4\u201319.2\u00a0kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging.\nDirect current (DC)[edit]\nCommonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle.[8][9]\n\nDC Level 1: Supplies a maximum of 80\u00a0kW at 50\u20131000\u00a0V.\nDC Level 2: Supplies a maximum of 400\u00a0kW at 50\u20131000\u00a0V.\nAdditional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196-2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices).\n\nIEC[edit]\nIn 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation.\n\n\nIEC 61851-1 modes[10][11][12]\n\n\nMode\nType\nMaximum supply\n\n\nCurrent (A)\nVoltage (V)\nPower (kW)\n\n\n1\n\n1\u03a6\u00a0AC\n16\n250\n4\n\n\n3\u03a6\u00a0AC\n16\n480\n11\n\n\n2\n\n1\u03a6\u00a0AC\n32\n250\n7.4\n\n\n3\u03a6\u00a0AC\n32\n480\n22\n\n\n3\n\n1\u03a6\u00a0AC\n63\n250\n14.5\n\n\n3\u03a6\u00a0AC\n63\n480\n43.5\n\n\n4\n\nDC\n200\n400\n80\n\nThe IEC alternatively defines charging in modes (IEC 61851-1):\n\nMode 1: slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC)\nMode 2: slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems)\nMode 3: slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196-2)\nMode 4: DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196-3, such as CHAdeMO)\nThe connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1):\n\nCase A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2.\nCase B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3.\nCase C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4.\nTesla NACS[edit]\nMain article: North American Charging System\nThe North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla.[13][14] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. \nAs of November 2023, automakers Ford, General Motors, Rivian, Volvo, Polestar, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Honda, Jaguar, Fisker, Hyundai, BMW, Toyota, Subaru, and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future.[15][16][17] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles.[18] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement.[19]\nTo meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points,[20] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480\u00a0V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers, which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average).[4]\n\nFuture development[edit]\nAn extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles (Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well, including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV),[21] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500\u00a0V and 0\u20133000\u00a0A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5\u00a0megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers.[22] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000\u00a0V DC (optionally, 1500\u00a0V DC) and 3000\u00a0A continuous rating.[23]\nA connector design was selected in May 2019[21] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors.[24] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2.[25][26]:\u200a3\u200a\nWith support from Portland General Electric, on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers. In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1\u00a0MW chargers once they are available.[27] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25\u00a0MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.[28]\n\nConnectors[edit]\nCommon charging connectorsIEC Type 4/CHAdeMO (left); CCS Combo 2 (center); IEC Type 2 outlet (right)IEC Type 1/SAE J1772 inlet (left); NACS (center); IEC Type 2 connector outlet (right)\nCommon connectors include Type 1 (Yazaki), Type 2 (Mennekes), CCS Combo 1 and 2, CHAdeMO, and Tesla.[29][30][31] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196-2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power):\n\nType 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications\nType 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2, SAE J3068, and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications\nType 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal\nType 4: DC fast-charge couplers\nConfiguration AA: CHAdeMO\nConfiguration BB: GB/T 20234.3\nConfigurations CC/DD: (reserved)\nConfiguration EE: CCS Combo 1\nConfiguration FF: CCS Combo 2\n\nConnector designs listed in IEC 62196-2 and -3[a]\n\n\nPower supply\nUnited States\nEuropean Union\nJapan\nChina\n\n\n1-phase AC(62196.2)\n\nType 1 (SAE J1772)\n\nType 2[b][c]\n\nType 1 (SAE J1772)\n\nType 2 (GB/T 20234.2)[d]\n\n\n3-phase AC(62196.2)\n\nType 2 (SAE J3068)\n\n\u2014\n\n\nDC(62196.3)\n\nEE (CCS Combo 1)\n\nFF (CCS Combo 2)[c]\n\nAA (CHAdeMO)[c]\n\nBB (GB/T 20234.3)[b]\n\n\nChaoJi\u00a0(planned)\n\nQuick Notes on EV Charger types\n\nNotes\n\n\n^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard\n\n^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3).[33]\n\n^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW).[32]\n\n^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use.\n\n\nCCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2.\nThe CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Toyota, while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM, Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, and Hyundai. Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated:\n\nThe broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out.[34]\nHistorical connectors[edit]\nPublic charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport. Shown are two obsolete 6\u00a0kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON).\nIn the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1, Ford Ranger EV, and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector (Magne Charge) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system.[5]:\u200a10\u201311\u200a\nMagne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV, but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter).[35] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead.[36][37]:\u200a23\u200a SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999.[37]:\u200a26\u200a\nThe influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability,[38] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March.[39] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria, and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler).[37]:\u200a22\u200a The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States.[37]:\u200a25\u200a[40] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America,[37]:\u200a22\u200a based on environmental and durability testing.[41] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212).[42] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete.[43]\n\n\nCharging time[edit]\n\n\n\nBYD e6. Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80%\n\n\n\nSolaris Urbino 12 electric, battery electric bus, inductive charging station\n\n\nCharging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power.[44] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid.[45]\nThe California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle, and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging.[46]\nCharge time can be calculated as:[47]\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Time (h)\n\n=\n\n\nBattery capacity (kWh)\nCharging power (kW)\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}}\n\n\nThe effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system, charging losses (which can be as high as 25%[48]), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller.\n\nBattery capacity[edit]\nThe usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20\u00a0kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km).[citation needed] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40\u00a0kWh, 60\u00a0kWh and 85\u00a0kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi).[49] As of 2022[update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km).[50]\n\nAC-to-DC conversion[edit]\nBatteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137\u00a0kW, sufficient for overnight charging.[51] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+\u00a0kW) is necessary.[citation needed] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.\n\n\nCharging time for 100\u00a0km (62 miles) of range on a 2020 Tesla Model S Long Range per EPA (111\u00a0MPGe / 188\u00a0Wh/km)[52]\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nVoltage\n\nCurrent\n\nPower\n\nCharging time\n\nComment\n\n\nSingle-phase AC\n\n120\u00a0V\n\n12\u00a0A\n\n1.44\u00a0kW\n\n13\u00a0hours\n\nThis is the maximum continuous power available from a standard US/Canadian 120\u00a0V 15\u00a0A circuit\n\n\nSingle-phase AC\n\n230\u00a0V\n\n16\u00a0A\n\n3.68\u00a0kW\n\n5.1\u00a0hours\n\nThis is the maximum continuous power available from a CEE 7/3 (\"Schuko\") receptacle on a 16\u00a0A rated circuit\n\n\nSingle-phase AC\n\n240\u00a0V\n\n30\u00a0A\n\n7.20\u00a0kW\n\n2.6\u00a0hours\n\nCommon maximum limit of public AC charging stations used in North America, such as a ChargePoint CT4000\n\n\nThree-phase AC\n\n400\u00a0V\n\n16\u00a0A\n\n11.0\u00a0kW\n\n1.7\u00a0hours\n\nMaximum limit of a European 16\u00a0A three-phase AC charging station\n\n\nThree-phase AC\n\n400\u00a0V\n\n32\u00a0A\n\n22.1\u00a0kW\n\n51\u00a0minutes\n\nMaximum limit of a European 32\u00a0A three-phase AC charging station\n\n\nDC\n\n400\u00a0V\n\n125\u00a0A\n\n50\u00a0kW\n\n22\u00a0minutes\n\nTypical mid-power DC charging station\n\n\nDC\n\n400\u00a0V\n\n300\u00a0A\n\n120\u00a0kW\n\n9\u00a0minutes\n\nTypical power from a Tesla V2 Tesla Supercharger\n\nSafety[edit]\n\n\n\nA Sunwin electric bus in Shanghai at a charging station\n\n\n\nA battery electric bus charging station in Geneva, Switzerland\n\n\nCharging stations are usually accessible to multiple electric vehicles and are equipped with current or connection sensing mechanisms to disconnect the power when the EV is not charging.\nThe two main types of safety sensors:\n\nCurrent sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range.[citation needed]\nSensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings.\nSensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement.[citation needed] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed.\n\nPublic charging stations over the world[edit]\nFurther information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle networkThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (February 2023)Public charging station signsUS traffic signPublic-domain international sign\nLonger drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh.[53]\nCharging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network.[54] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid.[55]\nCharging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment.[56]\nAs of December\u00a02012[update], around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China.[57] As of August\u00a02014[update], some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries.[58] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined.[59] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million.[60] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers.[61]\n\nAsia/Pacific[edit]\nAs of December\u00a02012[update], Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers.[57] As of December\u00a02012[update], China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations.[57]\nAs of September\u00a02013[update], the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne, with around 30 stations (7\u00a0kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities.[62]\nIn India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.[citation needed]\n\n\n\n\nCharging park in Beijing (2016)\n\n\n\n EV charging station, Seogwipo, Jeju Island, South Korea (2021)\n\n\n\nPrototype modified Renault Laguna EVs charging at Project Better Place charging stations in Ramat Hasharon, Israel, north of Tel Aviv (2010)\n\n\nEurope[edit]\nAs of December 2013, Estonia was the only country that had completed the deployment of an EV charging network with nationwide coverage, with 165 fast chargers available along highways at a maximum distance of between 40\u201360\u00a0km (25\u201337\u00a0mi), and a higher density in urban areas.[63][64][65]\n\n\n\n\nSwedish charging station with 400 kW fast chargers (2024)\n\n\n\nPublic charging park in Germany (2020)\n\n\n\nElectric-vehicle charging station near London (2023)\n\n\n\neVolt Tri-Rapid Compact Charger (left) and eVolt Standard Post charger with Type 1 and Type 2 ports in a car park in Arbroath, Scotland (2017)\n\n\n\nCar charging point in Moscow (2024)\n\n\n\nAral Pulse charging stations in front of a Aral-branded BP gas station in Braunschweig, Germany (2021)\n\n\n\nAs of November 2012, about 15,000 charging stations had been installed in Europe.[66] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations.[67] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast (DC) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned, aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents.[68] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009.[69]\nCompared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe.[70] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million.[70] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles.[71]\n\nNorth America[edit]\nAs of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada.[72]\nAs of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center.[72]\nAs of August\u00a02018[update], 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States,[73] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013.[74][75] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs).[76]\nColder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters. Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly.[77] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C, further limiting their value.[78]\nAs of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers.[79]\nOther charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America, EVgo, ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi, BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Lucid Motors, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. \nIn June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States.[80] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors.[81] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada.[82] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built.[83]\n\nAfrica[edit]\nBMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg, South Africa (2021)\nSouth African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW, Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide.[84]\n\nSouth America[edit]\nIn April 2017 YPF, the state-owned oil company of Argentina, reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory.[85]\n\nProjects[edit]\nMain article: Electric vehicle network\nElectric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations.\nThe EV Plug Alliance[86] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members (Schneider Electric, Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable.[87][88][89]\n\nHome chargers[edit]\nSee also: NEMA connector\nNEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes\nOver 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage.[90] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging.\nTo address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements.\nCharging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts,[91] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience.\n\nBattery swap[edit]\nMain article: Battery swapping\nA battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications.[92]\n\nHistory[edit]\nThe concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company, through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric.[93] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres).\nBeginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars.[94] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[95]\nBetter Place, Tesla, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches.[96][97] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications.\nIn 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network.[1] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps.[98] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down.[99]\n\nBenefits[edit]\nThe following benefits were claimed for battery swapping:\n\n\"Refueling\" in under five minutes.[100][101]\nAutomation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped.[102]\nSwitch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners.[103]\nSpare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services.[104]\nProviders[edit]\nA Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing\nThe Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark.[105]\nBetter Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron, near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes.[100][106] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013.[107][108]\nIn June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping. Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds.[101][109] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced.[101] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest.[110]\nBy 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe,[111] up from 131 in 2020.[112]\n\nSites[edit]\nCar connected to an EV charger over a parking space\nUnlike filling stations, which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking.\nPrivate locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels.[113] Residences are by far the most common charging location.[114] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit.[115] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet.[116] These cables may be wall mounted.[citation needed]\nPublic stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations.[117] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption.[118]\nPublic charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities.[119] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas, transit stations, and government offices.[120][121] Typically, AC Type 1/Type 2 plugs are used.\n\nWireless charging stationDetail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways.\nMobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery.\nAn offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service, will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea.[122] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms, Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships.[122]\n\nRelated technologies[edit]\nSmart grid[edit]\nA smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging.[123] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1.[124][125] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118, which also provide protocols for automatic payment.\n\nRenewable energy[edit]\nSee also: Solar vehicleThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (November 2023)\nElectric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power.[126]\nCharging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes.[127][128]\nTesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. \n\nSeveral Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012)\nThe E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76\u00a0kW of solar power.[129]\nIn 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4\u00a0kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation.[130]\n\n\nIn 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station.[131]\n\nAlternative technologies[edit]\nAlong a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden, which connects Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6, a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver.\nThis allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads.[132] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one,[133] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.[134]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Electric vehicle charging stations.\n\n\nAC adapter\nAutomated charging machine\nBattery charger\nDirect coupling\nElectric vehicle battery\nElectric vehicle network\nInductive charging\nGround-level power supply\nISO 15118\nList of energy storage projects\nMegawatt Charging System\nOpenEVSE\nPark & Charge\nSolar vehicle\nVehicle-to-grid\nCommercial projects:\n\nBattery electric multiple unit\nECOtality\nGridPoint\nIAV\nMagne Charge\nPlugless Power\nSolar Roadways\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Tesla Motors Launches Revolutionary Supercharger Enabling Convenient Long Distance Driving | Tesla Investor Relations\". ir.tesla.com. 24 September 2012.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle.\n\n^ \"Park and Ride Locations\".

For the company, see ChargePoint.\n\n\nCharging stations for electric vehicles:\nTop-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city, Japan.\nTop-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point.\nBottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas.\nBottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009).\nA charging station, also known as a charge point, chargepoint, or electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles, electric trucks, electric buses, neighborhood electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrid vehicles).\nThere are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power.\nCharging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards.\n\n\nPublic charging stations[edit]\nFred Meyer parking area\nPublic charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.\n\nStandards[edit]\nMultiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012.[1]\n\nNomenclature[edit]\nCharging station and vehicle terminology\nIn 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms:[2]\n\nSocket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle\nPlug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached.\nCable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle\nConnector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet\nVehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power\nThe terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\".[3]\nTesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE.[4]\n\nVoltage and power[edit]\nEarly standards[edit]\n\nNEC(1999) levels[5]:\u200a9\u200a\n\n\nMethod\nMaximum supply\n\n\nCurrent (A)\nVoltage (V)\nPower (kW)\n\n\nLevel 1 (1-phase AC)\n\n12\n120\n1.44\n\n\n16\n120\n1.92\n\n\n24\n120\n2.88\n\n\nLevel 2 (1-phase AC)\n\n32\n208/240\n7.68\n\n\nLevel 3 (3-phase AC)\n\n400\n480\n332.6\n\nThe National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States;[6] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook.[5]:\u200a9\u200a\nUnder the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5-20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16\u00a0amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A.[5]:\u200a9\u200a\nLevel 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit.[5]:\u200a9\u200a For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle (Magne Charge) or a conductive connector (Avcon).[5]:\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18\u200a\nLevel 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers.[5]:\u200a9\u200a\n\nSAE[edit]\n\nSAE J1772(2017) levels[7]\n\n\nMethod\nMaximum supply\n\n\nCurrent (A)\nVoltage (V)\nPower (kW)\n\n\nAC Level 1\n\n12\n120\n1.44\n\n\n16\n120\n1.92\n\n\nAC Level 2\n\n80\n208\u2013240\n19.2\n\n\nDC Level 1\n\n80\n50\u20131000\n80\n\n\nDC Level 2\n\n400\n50\u20131000\n400\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772, initially developed in 2001.[8] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power.\n\nAlternating current (AC)[edit]\nAC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply.[8]\n\nAC Level 1: Connects directly to a standard 120\u00a0V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316\u00a0A (0.7\u20131.92\u00a0kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit.\nAC Level 2: Uses 240\u00a0V (single phase) or 208\u00a0V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80\u00a0A (1.4\u201319.2\u00a0kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging.\nDirect current (DC)[edit]\nCommonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle.[8][9]\n\nDC Level 1: Supplies a maximum of 80\u00a0kW at 50\u20131000\u00a0V.\nDC Level 2: Supplies a maximum of 400\u00a0kW at 50\u20131000\u00a0V.\nAdditional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196-2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices).\n\nIEC[edit]\nIn 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation.\n\n\nIEC 61851-1 modes[10][11][12]\n\n\nMode\nType\nMaximum supply\n\n\nCurrent (A)\nVoltage (V)\nPower (kW)\n\n\n1\n\n1\u03a6\u00a0AC\n16\n250\n4\n\n\n3\u03a6\u00a0AC\n16\n480\n11\n\n\n2\n\n1\u03a6\u00a0AC\n32\n250\n7.4\n\n\n3\u03a6\u00a0AC\n32\n480\n22\n\n\n3\n\n1\u03a6\u00a0AC\n63\n250\n14.5\n\n\n3\u03a6\u00a0AC\n63\n480\n43.5\n\n\n4\n\nDC\n200\n400\n80\n\nThe IEC alternatively defines charging in modes (IEC 61851-1):\n\nMode 1: slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC)\nMode 2: slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems)\nMode 3: slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196-2)\nMode 4: DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196-3, such as CHAdeMO)\nThe connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1):\n\nCase A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2.\nCase B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3.\nCase C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4.\nTesla NACS[edit]\nMain article: North American Charging System\nThe North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla.[13][14] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. \nAs of November 2023, automakers Ford, General Motors, Rivian, Volvo, Polestar, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Honda, Jaguar, Fisker, Hyundai, BMW, Toyota, Subaru, and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future.[15][16][17] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles.[18] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement.[19]\nTo meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points,[20] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480\u00a0V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers, which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average).[4]\n\nFuture development[edit]\nAn extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles (Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well, including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV),[21] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500\u00a0V and 0\u20133000\u00a0A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5\u00a0megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers.[22] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000\u00a0V DC (optionally, 1500\u00a0V DC) and 3000\u00a0A continuous rating.[23]\nA connector design was selected in May 2019[21] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors.[24] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2.[25][26]:\u200a3\u200a\nWith support from Portland General Electric, on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers. In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1\u00a0MW chargers once they are available.[27] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25\u00a0MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.[28]\n\nConnectors[edit]\nCommon charging connectorsIEC Type 4/CHAdeMO (left); CCS Combo 2 (center); IEC Type 2 outlet (right)IEC Type 1/SAE J1772 inlet (left); NACS (center); IEC Type 2 connector outlet (right)\nCommon connectors include Type 1 (Yazaki), Type 2 (Mennekes), CCS Combo 1 and 2, CHAdeMO, and Tesla.[29][30][31] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196-2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power):\n\nType 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications\nType 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2, SAE J3068, and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications\nType 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal\nType 4: DC fast-charge couplers\nConfiguration AA: CHAdeMO\nConfiguration BB: GB/T 20234.3\nConfigurations CC/DD: (reserved)\nConfiguration EE: CCS Combo 1\nConfiguration FF: CCS Combo 2\n\nConnector designs listed in IEC 62196-2 and -3[a]\n\n\nPower supply\nUnited States\nEuropean Union\nJapan\nChina\n\n\n1-phase AC(62196.2)\n\nType 1 (SAE J1772)\n\nType 2[b][c]\n\nType 1 (SAE J1772)\n\nType 2 (GB/T 20234.2)[d]\n\n\n3-phase AC(62196.2)\n\nType 2 (SAE J3068)\n\n\u2014\n\n\nDC(62196.3)\n\nEE (CCS Combo 1)\n\nFF (CCS Combo 2)[c]\n\nAA (CHAdeMO)[c]\n\nBB (GB/T 20234.3)[b]\n\n\nChaoJi\u00a0(planned)\n\nQuick Notes on EV Charger types\n\nNotes\n\n\n^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard\n\n^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3).[33]\n\n^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW).[32]\n\n^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use.\n\n\nCCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2.\nThe CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Toyota, while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM, Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, and Hyundai. Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated:\n\nThe broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out.[34]\nHistorical connectors[edit]\nPublic charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport. Shown are two obsolete 6\u00a0kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON).\nIn the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1, Ford Ranger EV, and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector (Magne Charge) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system.[5]:\u200a10\u201311\u200a\nMagne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV, but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter).[35] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead.[36][37]:\u200a23\u200a SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999.[37]:\u200a26\u200a\nThe influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability,[38] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March.[39] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria, and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler).[37]:\u200a22\u200a The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States.[37]:\u200a25\u200a[40] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America,[37]:\u200a22\u200a based on environmental and durability testing.[41] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212).[42] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete.[43]\n\n\nCharging time[edit]\n\n\n\nBYD e6. Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80%\n\n\n\nSolaris Urbino 12 electric, battery electric bus, inductive charging station\n\n\nCharging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power.[44] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid.[45]\nThe California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle, and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging.[46]\nCharge time can be calculated as:[47]\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Time (h)\n\n=\n\n\nBattery capacity (kWh)\nCharging power (kW)\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}}\n\n\nThe effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system, charging losses (which can be as high as 25%[48]), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller.\n\nBattery capacity[edit]\nThe usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20\u00a0kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km).[citation needed] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40\u00a0kWh, 60\u00a0kWh and 85\u00a0kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi).[49] As of 2022[update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km).[50]\n\nAC-to-DC conversion[edit]\nBatteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137\u00a0kW, sufficient for overnight charging.[51] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+\u00a0kW) is necessary.[citation needed] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.\n\n\nCharging time for 100\u00a0km (62 miles) of range on a 2020 Tesla Model S Long Range per EPA (111\u00a0MPGe / 188\u00a0Wh/km)[52]\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nVoltage\n\nCurrent\n\nPower\n\nCharging time\n\nComment\n\n\nSingle-phase AC\n\n120\u00a0V\n\n12\u00a0A\n\n1.44\u00a0kW\n\n13\u00a0hours\n\nThis is the maximum continuous power available from a standard US/Canadian 120\u00a0V 15\u00a0A circuit\n\n\nSingle-phase AC\n\n230\u00a0V\n\n16\u00a0A\n\n3.68\u00a0kW\n\n5.1\u00a0hours\n\nThis is the maximum continuous power available from a CEE 7/3 (\"Schuko\") receptacle on a 16\u00a0A rated circuit\n\n\nSingle-phase AC\n\n240\u00a0V\n\n30\u00a0A\n\n7.20\u00a0kW\n\n2.6\u00a0hours\n\nCommon maximum limit of public AC charging stations used in North America, such as a ChargePoint CT4000\n\n\nThree-phase AC\n\n400\u00a0V\n\n16\u00a0A\n\n11.0\u00a0kW\n\n1.7\u00a0hours\n\nMaximum limit of a European 16\u00a0A three-phase AC charging station\n\n\nThree-phase AC\n\n400\u00a0V\n\n32\u00a0A\n\n22.1\u00a0kW\n\n51\u00a0minutes\n\nMaximum limit of a European 32\u00a0A three-phase AC charging station\n\n\nDC\n\n400\u00a0V\n\n125\u00a0A\n\n50\u00a0kW\n\n22\u00a0minutes\n\nTypical mid-power DC charging station\n\n\nDC\n\n400\u00a0V\n\n300\u00a0A\n\n120\u00a0kW\n\n9\u00a0minutes\n\nTypical power from a Tesla V2 Tesla Supercharger\n\nSafety[edit]\n\n\n\nA Sunwin electric bus in Shanghai at a charging station\n\n\n\nA battery electric bus charging station in Geneva, Switzerland\n\n\nCharging stations are usually accessible to multiple electric vehicles and are equipped with current or connection sensing mechanisms to disconnect the power when the EV is not charging.\nThe two main types of safety sensors:\n\nCurrent sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range.[citation needed]\nSensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings.\nSensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement.[citation needed] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed.\n\nPublic charging stations over the world[edit]\nFurther information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle networkThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (February 2023)Public charging station signsUS traffic signPublic-domain international sign\nLonger drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh.[53]\nCharging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network.[54] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid.[55]\nCharging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment.[56]\nAs of December\u00a02012[update], around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China.[57] As of August\u00a02014[update], some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries.[58] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined.[59] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million.[60] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers.[61]\n\nAsia/Pacific[edit]\nAs of December\u00a02012[update], Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers.[57] As of December\u00a02012[update], China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations.[57]\nAs of September\u00a02013[update], the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne, with around 30 stations (7\u00a0kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities.[62]\nIn India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.[citation needed]\n\n\n\n\nCharging park in Beijing (2016)\n\n\n\n EV charging station, Seogwipo, Jeju Island, South Korea (2021)\n\n\n\nPrototype modified Renault Laguna EVs charging at Project Better Place charging stations in Ramat Hasharon, Israel, north of Tel Aviv (2010)\n\n\nEurope[edit]\nAs of December 2013, Estonia was the only country that had completed the deployment of an EV charging network with nationwide coverage, with 165 fast chargers available along highways at a maximum distance of between 40\u201360\u00a0km (25\u201337\u00a0mi), and a higher density in urban areas.[63][64][65]\n\n\n\n\nSwedish charging station with 400 kW fast chargers (2024)\n\n\n\nPublic charging park in Germany (2020)\n\n\n\nElectric-vehicle charging station near London (2023)\n\n\n\neVolt Tri-Rapid Compact Charger (left) and eVolt Standard Post charger with Type 1 and Type 2 ports in a car park in Arbroath, Scotland (2017)\n\n\n\nCar charging point in Moscow (2024)\n\n\n\nAral Pulse charging stations in front of a Aral-branded BP gas station in Braunschweig, Germany (2021)\n\n\n\nAs of November 2012, about 15,000 charging stations had been installed in Europe.[66] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations.[67] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast (DC) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned, aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents.[68] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009.[69]\nCompared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe.[70] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million.[70] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles.[71]\n\nNorth America[edit]\nAs of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada.[72]\nAs of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center.[72]\nAs of August\u00a02018[update], 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States,[73] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013.[74][75] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs).[76]\nColder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters. Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly.[77] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C, further limiting their value.[78]\nAs of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers.[79]\nOther charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America, EVgo, ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi, BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Lucid Motors, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. \nIn June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States.[80] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors.[81] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada.[82] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built.[83]\n\nAfrica[edit]\nBMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg, South Africa (2021)\nSouth African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW, Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide.[84]\n\nSouth America[edit]\nIn April 2017 YPF, the state-owned oil company of Argentina, reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory.[85]\n\nProjects[edit]\nMain article: Electric vehicle network\nElectric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations.\nThe EV Plug Alliance[86] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members (Schneider Electric, Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable.[87][88][89]\n\nHome chargers[edit]\nSee also: NEMA connector\nNEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes\nOver 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage.[90] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging.\nTo address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements.\nCharging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts,[91] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience.\n\nBattery swap[edit]\nMain article: Battery swapping\nA battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications.[92]\n\nHistory[edit]\nThe concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company, through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric.[93] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres).\nBeginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars.[94] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[95]\nBetter Place, Tesla, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches.[96][97] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications.\nIn 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network.[1] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps.[98] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down.[99]\n\nBenefits[edit]\nThe following benefits were claimed for battery swapping:\n\n\"Refueling\" in under five minutes.[100][101]\nAutomation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped.[102]\nSwitch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners.[103]\nSpare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services.[104]\nProviders[edit]\nA Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing\nThe Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark.[105]\nBetter Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron, near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes.[100][106] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013.[107][108]\nIn June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping. Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds.[101][109] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced.[101] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest.[110]\nBy 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe,[111] up from 131 in 2020.[112]\n\nSites[edit]\nCar connected to an EV charger over a parking space\nUnlike filling stations, which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking.\nPrivate locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels.[113] Residences are by far the most common charging location.[114] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit.[115] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet.[116] These cables may be wall mounted.[citation needed]\nPublic stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations.[117] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption.[118]\nPublic charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities.[119] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas, transit stations, and government offices.[120][121] Typically, AC Type 1/Type 2 plugs are used.\n\nWireless charging stationDetail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways.\nMobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery.\nAn offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service, will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea.[122] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms, Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships.[122]\n\nRelated technologies[edit]\nSmart grid[edit]\nA smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging.[123] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1.[124][125] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118, which also provide protocols for automatic payment.\n\nRenewable energy[edit]\nSee also: Solar vehicleThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (November 2023)\nElectric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power.[126]\nCharging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes.[127][128]\nTesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. \n\nSeveral Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012)\nThe E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76\u00a0kW of solar power.[129]\nIn 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4\u00a0kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation.[130]\n\n\nIn 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station.[131]\n\nAlternative technologies[edit]\nAlong a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden, which connects Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6, a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver.\nThis allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads.[132] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one,[133] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.[134]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Electric vehicle charging stations.\n\n\nAC adapter\nAutomated charging machine\nBattery charger\nDirect coupling\nElectric vehicle battery\nElectric vehicle network\nInductive charging\nGround-level power supply\nISO 15118\nList of energy storage projects\nMegawatt Charging System\nOpenEVSE\nPark & Charge\nSolar vehicle\nVehicle-to-grid\nCommercial projects:\n\nBattery electric multiple unit\nECOtality\nGridPoint\nIAV\nMagne Charge\nPlugless Power\nSolar Roadways\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Tesla Motors Launches Revolutionary Supercharger Enabling Convenient Long Distance Driving | Tesla Investor Relations\". ir.tesla.com. 24 September 2012.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle.\n\n^ \"Park and Ride Locations\".

For the company, see ChargePoint.\n\n\nCharging stations for electric vehicles:\nTop-left: a Tesla Roadster (2008) being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city, Japan.\nTop-right: Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point.\nBottom-left: Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston, Texas.\nBottom-right: converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco, California (2009).\nA charging station, also known as a charge point, chargepoint, or electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles, electric trucks, electric buses, neighborhood electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrid vehicles).\nThere are two main types of EV chargers: Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC) charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power.\nCharging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards.\n\n\nPublic charging stations[edit]\nFred Meyer parking area\nPublic charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.\n\nStandards[edit]\nMultiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012.[1]\n\nNomenclature[edit]\nCharging station and vehicle terminology\nIn 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) defined the following terms:[2]\n\nSocket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle\nPlug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached.\nCable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle\nConnector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet\nVehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power\nThe terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States National Electrical Code (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\".[3]\nTesla, Inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual EVSE.[4]\n\nVoltage and power[edit]\nEarly standards[edit]\n\nNEC(1999) levels[5]:\u200a9\u200a\n\n\nMethod\nMaximum supply\n\n\nCurrent (A)\nVoltage (V)\nPower (kW)\n\n\nLevel 1 (1-phase AC)\n\n12\n120\n1.44\n\n\n16\n120\n1.92\n\n\n24\n120\n2.88\n\n\nLevel 2 (1-phase AC)\n\n32\n208/240\n7.68\n\n\nLevel 3 (3-phase AC)\n\n400\n480\n332.6\n\nThe National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the Electric Power Research Institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States;[6] early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC) Handbook.[5]:\u200a9\u200a\nUnder the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard NEMA 5-20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16\u00a0amperes (\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20\u00a0A.[5]:\u200a9\u200a\nLevel 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40\u00a0A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit.[5]:\u200a9\u200a For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle (Magne Charge) or a conductive connector (Avcon).[5]:\u200a10\u201311,\u200a18\u200a\nLevel 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers.[5]:\u200a9\u200a\n\nSAE[edit]\n\nSAE J1772(2017) levels[7]\n\n\nMethod\nMaximum supply\n\n\nCurrent (A)\nVoltage (V)\nPower (kW)\n\n\nAC Level 1\n\n12\n120\n1.44\n\n\n16\n120\n1.92\n\n\nAC Level 2\n\n80\n208\u2013240\n19.2\n\n\nDC Level 1\n\n80\n50\u20131000\n80\n\n\nDC Level 2\n\n400\n50\u20131000\n400\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard SAE J1772, initially developed in 2001.[8] SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power.\n\nAlternating current (AC)[edit]\nAC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply.[8]\n\nAC Level 1: Connects directly to a standard 120\u00a0V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6\u201316\u00a0A (0.7\u20131.92\u00a0kilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit.\nAC Level 2: Uses 240\u00a0V (single phase) or 208\u00a0V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80\u00a0A (1.4\u201319.2\u00a0kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging.\nDirect current (DC)[edit]\nCommonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle.[8][9]\n\nDC Level 1: Supplies a maximum of 80\u00a0kW at 50\u20131000\u00a0V.\nDC Level 2: Supplies a maximum of 400\u00a0kW at 50\u20131000\u00a0V.\nAdditional standards released by SAE for charging include SAE J3068 (three-phase AC charging, using the Type 2 connector defined in IEC 62196-2) and SAE J3105 (automated connection of DC charging devices).\n\nIEC[edit]\nIn 2003, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted a majority of the SAE J1772 standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation.\n\n\nIEC 61851-1 modes[10][11][12]\n\n\nMode\nType\nMaximum supply\n\n\nCurrent (A)\nVoltage (V)\nPower (kW)\n\n\n1\n\n1\u03a6\u00a0AC\n16\n250\n4\n\n\n3\u03a6\u00a0AC\n16\n480\n11\n\n\n2\n\n1\u03a6\u00a0AC\n32\n250\n7.4\n\n\n3\u03a6\u00a0AC\n32\n480\n22\n\n\n3\n\n1\u03a6\u00a0AC\n63\n250\n14.5\n\n\n3\u03a6\u00a0AC\n63\n480\n43.5\n\n\n4\n\nDC\n200\n400\n80\n\nThe IEC alternatively defines charging in modes (IEC 61851-1):\n\nMode 1: slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or three-phase AC)\nMode 2: slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the Park & Charge or the PARVE systems)\nMode 3: slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. SAE J1772 and IEC 62196-2)\nMode 4: DC fast charging using a specific charging interface (i.e. IEC 62196-3, such as CHAdeMO)\nThe connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1):\n\nCase A: any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2.\nCase B: an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle \u2013 usually mode 3.\nCase C: DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4.\nTesla NACS[edit]\nMain article: North American Charging System\nThe North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by Tesla, Inc. for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla.[13][14] The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality. \nAs of November 2023, automakers Ford, General Motors, Rivian, Volvo, Polestar, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Honda, Jaguar, Fisker, Hyundai, BMW, Toyota, Subaru, and Lucid Motors have all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future.[15][16][17] Automotive startup Aptera Motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles.[18] Other automakers, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen have not made an announcement.[19]\nTo meet European Union (EU) requirements on recharging points,[20] Tesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a CCS Combo 2 port. Both the North America and the EU port take 480\u00a0V DC fast charging through Tesla's network of Superchargers, which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250\u00a0kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average).[4]\n\nFuture development[edit]\nAn extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles (Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well, including school and transit buses). When the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV),[21] later renamed Megawatt Charging System (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200\u20131500\u00a0V and 0\u20133000\u00a0A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5\u00a0megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers.[22] The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000\u00a0V DC (optionally, 1500\u00a0V DC) and 3000\u00a0A continuous rating.[23]\nA connector design was selected in May 2019[21] and tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors.[24] The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2.[25][26]:\u200a3\u200a\nWith support from Portland General Electric, on 21 April 2021 Daimler Trucks North America opened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers. In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1\u00a0MW chargers once they are available.[27] A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25\u00a0MW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.[28]\n\nConnectors[edit]\nCommon charging connectorsIEC Type 4/CHAdeMO (left); CCS Combo 2 (center); IEC Type 2 outlet (right)IEC Type 1/SAE J1772 inlet (left); NACS (center); IEC Type 2 connector outlet (right)\nCommon connectors include Type 1 (Yazaki), Type 2 (Mennekes), CCS Combo 1 and 2, CHAdeMO, and Tesla.[29][30][31] Many standard plug types are defined in IEC 62196-2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power):\n\nType 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications\nType 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler \u2013 VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2, SAE J3068, and GB/T 20234.2 plug specifications\nType 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters \u2013 EV Plug Alliance proposal\nType 4: DC fast-charge couplers\nConfiguration AA: CHAdeMO\nConfiguration BB: GB/T 20234.3\nConfigurations CC/DD: (reserved)\nConfiguration EE: CCS Combo 1\nConfiguration FF: CCS Combo 2\n\nConnector designs listed in IEC 62196-2 and -3[a]\n\n\nPower supply\nUnited States\nEuropean Union\nJapan\nChina\n\n\n1-phase AC(62196.2)\n\nType 1 (SAE J1772)\n\nType 2[b][c]\n\nType 1 (SAE J1772)\n\nType 2 (GB/T 20234.2)[d]\n\n\n3-phase AC(62196.2)\n\nType 2 (SAE J3068)\n\n\u2014\n\n\nDC(62196.3)\n\nEE (CCS Combo 1)\n\nFF (CCS Combo 2)[c]\n\nAA (CHAdeMO)[c]\n\nBB (GB/T 20234.3)[b]\n\n\nChaoJi\u00a0(planned)\n\nQuick Notes on EV Charger types\n\nNotes\n\n\n^ For pin definitions, see page for each specific standard\n\n^ a b In India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100\u00a0V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A / 10\u00a0kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the IEC 60309 three-pin connector. For DC charging (48\u201372+\u00a0V, 200\u00a0A / 15\u00a0kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3).[33]\n\n^ a b c For high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (\u226522\u00a0kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (\u226550\u00a0kW).[32]\n\n^ Although GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use.\n\n\nCCS DC charging requires power-line communication (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2.\nThe CHAdeMO standard is favored by Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Toyota, while the SAE J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM, Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, and Hyundai. Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated:\n\nThe broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out.[34]\nHistorical connectors[edit]\nPublic charging stations in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport. Shown are two obsolete 6\u00a0kW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON).\nIn the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the GM EV1, Ford Ranger EV, and Chevrolet S-10 EV preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector (Magne Charge) or a conductive connector (generally AVCON). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system.[5]:\u200a10\u201311\u200a\nMagne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV, but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter).[35] The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead.[36][37]:\u200a23\u200a SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999.[37]:\u200a26\u200a\nThe influential California Air Resources Board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability,[38] and the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March.[39] Three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford, Solectria, and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler).[37]:\u200a22\u200a The Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States.[37]:\u200a25\u200a[40] IWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America,[37]:\u200a22\u200a based on environmental and durability testing.[41] As implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC\u2212).[42] By 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete.[43]\n\n\nCharging time[edit]\n\n\n\nBYD e6. Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80%\n\n\n\nSolaris Urbino 12 electric, battery electric bus, inductive charging station\n\n\nCharging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power.[44] The larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid.[45]\nThe California Air Resources Board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle, and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging.[46]\nCharge time can be calculated as:[47]\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Time (h)\n\n=\n\n\nBattery capacity (kWh)\nCharging power (kW)\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}}\n\n\nThe effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system, charging losses (which can be as high as 25%[48]), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller.\n\nBattery capacity[edit]\nThe usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20\u00a0kilowatt-hours (kWh), giving it a range of about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km).[citation needed] Tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their Model S with battery capacities of 40\u00a0kWh, 60\u00a0kWh and 85\u00a0kWh, with the latter lasting for about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi).[49] As of 2022[update] plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15\u00a0to 60 miles (24\u201397\u00a0km).[50]\n\nAC-to-DC conversion[edit]\nBatteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6\u20137\u00a0kW, sufficient for overnight charging.[51] This is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50\u2013100+\u00a0kW) is necessary.[citation needed] This requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.\n\n\nCharging time for 100\u00a0km (62 miles) of range on a 2020 Tesla Model S Long Range per EPA (111\u00a0MPGe / 188\u00a0Wh/km)[52]\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nVoltage\n\nCurrent\n\nPower\n\nCharging time\n\nComment\n\n\nSingle-phase AC\n\n120\u00a0V\n\n12\u00a0A\n\n1.44\u00a0kW\n\n13\u00a0hours\n\nThis is the maximum continuous power available from a standard US/Canadian 120\u00a0V 15\u00a0A circuit\n\n\nSingle-phase AC\n\n230\u00a0V\n\n16\u00a0A\n\n3.68\u00a0kW\n\n5.1\u00a0hours\n\nThis is the maximum continuous power available from a CEE 7/3 (\"Schuko\") receptacle on a 16\u00a0A rated circuit\n\n\nSingle-phase AC\n\n240\u00a0V\n\n30\u00a0A\n\n7.20\u00a0kW\n\n2.6\u00a0hours\n\nCommon maximum limit of public AC charging stations used in North America, such as a ChargePoint CT4000\n\n\nThree-phase AC\n\n400\u00a0V\n\n16\u00a0A\n\n11.0\u00a0kW\n\n1.7\u00a0hours\n\nMaximum limit of a European 16\u00a0A three-phase AC charging station\n\n\nThree-phase AC\n\n400\u00a0V\n\n32\u00a0A\n\n22.1\u00a0kW\n\n51\u00a0minutes\n\nMaximum limit of a European 32\u00a0A three-phase AC charging station\n\n\nDC\n\n400\u00a0V\n\n125\u00a0A\n\n50\u00a0kW\n\n22\u00a0minutes\n\nTypical mid-power DC charging station\n\n\nDC\n\n400\u00a0V\n\n300\u00a0A\n\n120\u00a0kW\n\n9\u00a0minutes\n\nTypical power from a Tesla V2 Tesla Supercharger\n\nSafety[edit]\n\n\n\nA Sunwin electric bus in Shanghai at a charging station\n\n\n\nA battery electric bus charging station in Geneva, Switzerland\n\n\nCharging stations are usually accessible to multiple electric vehicles and are equipped with current or connection sensing mechanisms to disconnect the power when the EV is not charging.\nThe two main types of safety sensors:\n\nCurrent sensors monitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range.[citation needed]\nSensor wires provide a feedback signal such as specified by the SAE J1772 and IEC 62196 schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings.\nSensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement.[citation needed] Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed.\n\nPublic charging stations over the world[edit]\nFurther information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government: electric vehicle networkThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (February 2023)Public charging station signsUS traffic signPublic-domain international sign\nLonger drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh.[53]\nCharging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network.[54] The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid.[55]\nCharging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. Options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment.[56]\nAs of December\u00a02012[update], around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China.[57] As of August\u00a02014[update], some 3,869 CHAdeMO quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in Japan, 1,181 in Europe and 686 in the United States, and 24 in other countries.[58] As of December 2021 the total number of public and private EV charging stations was over 57,000 in the United States and Canada combined.[59] As of May 2023, there are over 3.9 million public EV charging points worldwide, with Europe having over 600,000, China leading with over 2.7 million.[60] United States has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In January 2023, S&P Global Mobility estimated that the US has about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers.[61]\n\nAsia/Pacific[edit]\nAs of December\u00a02012[update], Japan had 1,381 public DC fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 AC chargers.[57] As of December\u00a02012[update], China had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast-charging stations.[57]\nAs of September\u00a02013[update], the largest public charging networks in Australia were in the capital cities of Perth and Melbourne, with around 30 stations (7\u00a0kW AC) established in both cities \u2013 smaller networks exist in other capital cities.[62]\nIn India, public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.[citation needed]\n\n\n\n\nCharging park in Beijing (2016)\n\n\n\n EV charging station, Seogwipo, Jeju Island, South Korea (2021)\n\n\n\nPrototype modified Renault Laguna EVs charging at Project Better Place charging stations in Ramat Hasharon, Israel, north of Tel Aviv (2010)\n\n\nEurope[edit]\nAs of December 2013, Estonia was the only country that had completed the deployment of an EV charging network with nationwide coverage, with 165 fast chargers available along highways at a maximum distance of between 40\u201360\u00a0km (25\u201337\u00a0mi), and a higher density in urban areas.[63][64][65]\n\n\n\n\nSwedish charging station with 400 kW fast chargers (2024)\n\n\n\nPublic charging park in Germany (2020)\n\n\n\nElectric-vehicle charging station near London (2023)\n\n\n\neVolt Tri-Rapid Compact Charger (left) and eVolt Standard Post charger with Type 1 and Type 2 ports in a car park in Arbroath, Scotland (2017)\n\n\n\nCar charging point in Moscow (2024)\n\n\n\nAral Pulse charging stations in front of a Aral-branded BP gas station in Braunschweig, Germany (2021)\n\n\n\nAs of November 2012, about 15,000 charging stations had been installed in Europe.[66] As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations.[67] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast (DC) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by ABB and Dutch startup Fastned, aiming to provide at least one station every 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) for the Netherlands' 16 million residents.[68] In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009.[69]\nCompared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe.[70] In 2018 and 2019 the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of \u20ac200\u00a0million.[70] The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles.[71]\n\nNorth America[edit]\nAs of February 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast-charging stations, across the United States and Canada.[72]\nAs of October 2023, in the U.S. and Canada, there are 6,502 stations with CHAdeMO connectors, 7,480 stations with SAE CCS1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with Tesla North American Charging System (NACS) connectors, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center.[72]\nAs of August\u00a02018[update], 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the United States,[73] up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013.[74][75] By July 2020, Tesla had installed 1,971 stations (17,467 plugs).[76]\nColder areas in northern US states and Canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters. Although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly.[77] In public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C, further limiting their value.[78]\nAs of late 2023, a limited number of Tesla Superchargers are starting to open to non-Tesla vehicles through the use of a built in CCS adapter for existing superchargers.[79]\nOther charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. Networks like Electrify America, EVgo, ChargeFinder and ChargePoint are popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including Audi, BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Lucid Motors, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. \nIn June 2022, United States President Biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States.[80] The US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors.[81] One such proposed corridor called Greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada.[82] However, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built.[83]\n\nAfrica[edit]\nBMW Electric Wireless car charger in Johannesburg, South Africa (2021)\nSouth African based ElectroSA and automobile manufacturers including BMW, Nissan and Jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide.[84]\n\nSouth America[edit]\nIn April 2017 YPF, the state-owned oil company of Argentina, reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory.[85]\n\nProjects[edit]\nMain article: Electric vehicle network\nElectric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations.\nThe EV Plug Alliance[86] is an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an IEC norm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members (Schneider Electric, Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable.[87][88][89]\n\nHome chargers[edit]\nSee also: NEMA connector\nNEMA 14-50 240 volt 50 amperes\nOver 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage.[90] In North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) of range per hour of charging.\nTo address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48\u00a0km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements.\nCharging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts,[91] offering a faster and more efficient charging experience.\n\nBattery swap[edit]\nMain article: Battery swapping\nA battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications.[92]\n\nHistory[edit]\nThe concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company, through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric.[93] The power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6\u00a0million miles (9.7\u00a0million kilometres).\nBeginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars.[94] 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[95]\nBetter Place, Tesla, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries considered battery switch approaches.[96][97] One complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications.\nIn 2012, Tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging Tesla Supercharger network.[1] In 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps.[98] A demonstration swapping station was built at Harris Ranch and operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down.[99]\n\nBenefits[edit]\nThe following benefits were claimed for battery swapping:\n\n\"Refueling\" in under five minutes.[100][101]\nAutomation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped.[102]\nSwitch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners.[103]\nSpare batteries could participate in vehicle-to-grid energy services.[104]\nProviders[edit]\nA Nio battery swap station at a carpark in Beijing\nThe Better Place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark.[105]\nBetter Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron, near Rehovot in March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes.[100][106] Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013.[107][108]\nIn June 2013, Tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping. Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds.[101][109] Elon Musk said the service would be offered at around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced.[101] In 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest.[110]\nBy 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker Nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe,[111] up from 131 in 2020.[112]\n\nSites[edit]\nCar connected to an EV charger over a parking space\nUnlike filling stations, which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking.\nPrivate locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels.[113] Residences are by far the most common charging location.[114] Residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit.[115] Many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet.[116] These cables may be wall mounted.[citation needed]\nPublic stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations.[117] Some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption.[118]\nPublic charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities.[119] Sites include malls, freeway rest areas, transit stations, and government offices.[120][121] Typically, AC Type 1/Type 2 plugs are used.\n\nWireless charging stationDetail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways.\nMobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery.\nAn offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm Maersk Supply Service, will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea.[122] Connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms, Stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships.[122]\n\nRelated technologies[edit]\nSmart grid[edit]\nA smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging.[123] Vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1.[124][125] ISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as ISO/IEC 15118, which also provide protocols for automatic payment.\n\nRenewable energy[edit]\nSee also: Solar vehicleThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (November 2023)\nElectric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power.[126]\nCharging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023, Electrify America has invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America\u2019s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes.[127][128]\nTesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. \n\nSeveral Chevrolet Volts at a charging station partially powered with solar panels in Frankfort, Illinois (2012)\nThe E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76\u00a0kW of solar power.[129]\nIn 2012, Urban Green Energy introduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4\u00a0kW vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a GE WattStation.[130]\n\n\nIn 2021, Nova Innovation introduced the world's first direct from tidal power EV charge station.[131]\n\nAlternative technologies[edit]\nAlong a section of the Highway E20 in Sweden, which connects Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6, a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver.\nThis allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. The technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000\u00a0km of Swedish roads.[132] Sweden's first electrified stretch of road, and the world's first permanent one,[133] connects the Hallsberg and \u00d6rebro area. The work is scheduled for completion by 2025.[134]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Electric vehicle charging stations.\n\n\nAC adapter\nAutomated charging machine\nBattery charger\nDirect coupling\nElectric vehicle battery\nElectric vehicle network\nInductive charging\nGround-level power supply\nISO 15118\nList of energy storage projects\nMegawatt Charging System\nOpenEVSE\nPark & Charge\nSolar vehicle\nVehicle-to-grid\nCommercial projects:\n\nBattery electric multiple unit\nECOtality\nGridPoint\nIAV\nMagne Charge\nPlugless Power\nSolar Roadways\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Tesla Motors Launches Revolutionary Supercharger Enabling Convenient Long Distance Driving | Tesla Investor Relations\". ir.tesla.com. 24 September 2012.

In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle.\n\n^ \"Park and Ride Locations\".

It has been included in several international vehicle charging standards.\nThe second-generation specification allows for up to 400\u00a0kW by 1\u00a0kV, 400\u00a0A direct current.[3][4] The CHAdeMO Association is currently co-developing with China Electricity Council (CEC) the third-generation standard with the working name of \u201cChaoJi\u201d that aims to deliver 900\u00a0kW.[5]\nThe charging system is now considered outdated in the U.S, with the Nissan Leaf and the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV being the only models to use it in the country.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nCHAdeMO connector (left), with the competing Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 2 connector (middle), and the AC Type 2 connector (right)\nCHAdeMO originated out of a charging system design from the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). TEPCO had been participating on numerous EV infrastructure trial projects between 2006 and 2009 in collaboration with Nissan, Mitsubishi, Fuji Heavy Industries (now Subaru), and other manufacturers.[6] These trials resulted in TEPCO developing patented technology and a specification,[7] which would form the basis for the CHAdeMO.[8]\nThe first commercial CHAdeMO charging infrastructure was commissioned in 2009 alongside the launch of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV.[9]\nIn March 2010, TEPCO formed the CHAdeMO Association with Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Subaru.[10] They were later joined by Hitachi, Honda and Panasonic.[11][12] CHAdeMO would be the first organization to propose a standardized DC fast charge system  to be shared across diverse EVs, regardless of their brands and models.\nCHAdeMO became a published international standard in 2014 when the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted IEC 61851-23 for the charging system, IEC 61851-24 for communication, and IEC 62196-3 configuration AA for the connector.[13] Later that year, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (EN) added CHAdeMO as a published standard along with CCS Combo 2, followed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2016.[14]\nA major blow to the international adoption of CHAdeMO came in 2013 when European Commission designated the Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 2 as the mandated plug for DC high-power charging infrastructure in Europe.[15] While the European Parliament had contemplated transitioning out CHAdeMO infrastructure by January 2019, the final mandate only required that all publicly accessible chargers in the EU be equipped 'at least' with CCS Combo 2, allowing stations to offer multiple connector types.[16][17]\nWhile CHAdeMO was the first fast-charging standard to see widespread deployment and remains widely equipped on vehicles sold in Japan, it has been losing market share in other countries. Honda was the first of the CHAdeMO Association members to stop equipping the connector on vehicles sold outside of Japan starting with the Clarity Electric in 2016. Nissan decided not to use CHAdeMO on its Ariya SUVs introduced in 2021 outside of Japan. Toyota and Subaru have also equipped their jointly developed bZ4X/Solterra with CCS connectors outside of Japan. As of June\u00a02022[update], the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV and Nissan Leaf are the only plug-in vehicles equipped with CHAdeMO for sale in North America.[18]\nAs demand increased for EV charging services for Tesla vehicles after 2019, and prior to opening of the competing North American Charging System (NACS) in late 2022, several electric vehicle charging network operators had added some Tesla charging connector adapters to CHAdeMO-standard charging stations. These included, ONroute rest stop network in Ontario, Canada\u2014where a Tesla adaptor was permanently attached to a CHAdeMO connector on some 60 charge stations\u2014[19] and REVEL opened a charging station in Brooklyn for a while after they were denied a license to operate a Tesla ride-hailing fleet in New York City.[20] Also, EVgo, added a few optional Tesla adaptors to CHAdeMO connectors as early as 2019.[21][22]\n\nConnector design[edit]\nCHAdeMO\n\nCHAdeMO electric vehicle connectorType\nAutomotive power connectorProduction historyProduced\nSince 2009General specificationsDiameter\n70 millimetres (2.8\u00a0in)Pins\n10 (1 reserved)ElectricalSignal\nhigh-voltage DCPinout\n\nPinouts for CHAdeMO, looking at end of vehicle connectorFG\nGround\nreference for control linesSS1 / SS2\nCharge sequence signal\nstart/stop chargingN/C\n(not connected)\nDCP\nCharging enable\nvehicle grants EVSE permission to connect powerDC+ / DC-\nDC power\nsupplied powerPP\nConnector proximity detection\ncharge interlock, disables drivetrain while connectedC-H / C-L\nCAN bus\ncommunication with vehicle bus to establish operational parameters\nDC fast charge[edit]\nMost electric vehicles (EV) have an on-board charger that uses a full bridge rectifier to transform alternating current (AC) from the electrical grid to direct current (DC) suitable for recharging the EV's battery pack.[23] Most EVs are designed with limited AC input power, typically based on the available power of consumer outlets: for example, 240\u00a0V, 30\u00a0A in the United States and Japan; 240\u00a0V, 40\u00a0A in Canada; and 230\u00a0V, 15\u00a0A or 3\u03c6, 400\u00a0V, 32\u00a0A in Europe and Australia. AC chargers with higher limits have been specified, for example SAE J1772-2009 has an option for 240\u00a0V, 80\u00a0A and VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 has a 3\u03c6, 400\u00a0V, 63\u00a0A. But these charger types have been rarely deployed.\nCost and thermal issues limit how much power the rectifier can handle, so beyond approximately 240\u00a0V AC and 75\u00a0A it is better for an external charging station to deliver DC directly to the battery. For faster charging, dedicated DC chargers can be built in permanent locations and provided with high-current connections to the grid. Such high voltage and high-current charging is called a DC fast charge (DCFC) or DC quick charging (DCQC).[24]\n\nConnector protocols and history[edit]\nWhile the notion of shared off-board DC charging infrastructure, together with the charging system design for CHAdeMO came out of TEPCOs trials starting in 2006, the connector itself had been designed in 1993, and was specified by the 1993 Japan Electric Vehicle Standard (JEVS) G105-1993 from the JARI.[25]\nIn addition to carrying power, the connector also makes a data connection using the CAN bus protocol.[26] This performs functions such as a safety interlock to avoid energizing the connector before it is safe (similar to SAE J1772), transmitting battery parameters to the charging station including when to stop charging (top battery percentage, usually 80%), target voltage, total battery capacity, and how the station should vary its output current while charging.[27]\nThe first protocol issued was CHAdeMO 0.9, which offered maximum charging power of 62.5\u00a0kW (125\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC). Version 1.0 followed in 2012, enhancing vehicle protection, compatibility, and reliability. Version 1.1 (2015) allowed the current to dynamically change during charging; Version 1.2 (2017) increased maximum power to 200\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 500\u00a0V DC).\nCHAdeMO published its protocol for 400\u00a0kW (400\u00a0A \u00d7 1\u00a0kV) 'ultra-fast' charging in May 2018 as CHAdeMO 2.0.[28] CHAdeMO 2.0 allowed the standard to better compete with the CCS 'ultra-fast' stations being built around the world as part of new networks such as IONITY charging consortium.[29]\n\nVehicle-to-grid (V2G)[edit]\nIn 2014, CHAdeMO published its protocol for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration, which also includes applications for vehicle to load (V2L) or vehicle to home-off grid (V2H), collectively denoted V2X. The technology enables EV owners to use the car as an energy storage device, potentially lowering costs by optimising energy usage for the current time of use pricing and providing electricity to the grid.[30][31] Since 2012, multiple V2X demo projects using the CHAdeMO protocol have been demonstrated worldwide. Some of the recent projects include UCSD INVENT[32] in the United States, as well as Sciurus and e4Future[33] in the United Kingdom that are supported by Innovate UK.\n\nCHAdeMO 3.0: ChaoJi[edit]\nThis section is an excerpt from ChaoJi.[edit]\nThe ChaoJi connector, also referenced as CHAdeMO 3.0, is a high-power charging standard for electric cars, released in 2020.[34] The connector has a lemniscate shape (\u221e), with a flat bottom edge and is planned for charging battery electric vehicles at up to 900 kilowatts using direct current.  The design incorporates backward compatibility with CHAdeMO (used globally) and the GB/T DC-charging (used mainly in mainland China),[35] using a dedicated inlet adapter for each system. The circuit interface of ChaoJi is also designed to be fully compatible with the Combined Charging System, also known as CCS (used mainly in Europe and North America).[36]\n\nA joint agreement between the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council (with State Grid Corporation of China) was signed on 28 August 2018[37] after which the development was enlarged to a larger international community of experts.[38]\nCharge2Bike[edit]\nA CHAdeMO standard for Electrically Power Assisted Cycle (EPAC) Electric bicycles charger (Charge2Bike v1.2) was released in late 2024[39]. OEM like Bosch, Shimano, Yamaha and Panasonic are involved. \nThe standard allows (fast) charging of the battery with direct current without the need to bring along the specific charger that connects to the AC grid. It provides up to 60 Volt DC, the Extra-low voltage deemed safe, and up to 20 A (max. 800 W).\nSimilar standards already exist: the common USB-C is limited to 240 Watt (48 Volt, 5 Amp\u00e8re), while EnergyBus (48V, 30A, 1200W) already offers public chargers in parts of Europe, at higher power.\n\nDeployment[edit]\nCHAdeMO-type fast charging stations were initially installed in great numbers by TEPCO in Japan, which required the creation of an additional power distribution network to supply these stations.[40]\nSince then, CHAdeMO charger installation has expanded its geographical reach and in May 2023, the CHAdeMO Association stated that there were 57,800 CHAdeMO chargers installed in 99 countries. These included 9,600 charging stations in Japan, 31,600 in Europe, 9,400 in North America, and 7,000 elsewhere.[41]\nAs of January 2022, a total of 260 certified CHAdeMO charger models have been produced by 50 companies.[42]\n\nGallery[edit]\n\n\n\nA TEPCO branded charger in Vacaville, California, United States \n\n\n\nA charging site in Quebec, Canada with a 50\u00a0kW CHAdeMO / CCS \"combo\" DC fast charger and a Level 2 AC connector.\n\n\n\nA \"combo\" fast charger station with Type 2, CHAdeMO, and CCS connectors\n\n\n\nCHAdeMO plug\n\n\n\nCHAdeMO charging inlet (left) on a Nissan Leaf.

It is an extension of the J1772 standard AC charging connector.\nCCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins\nConnectors: Incomplete Combo 2 (left) showing the two large direct current (DC) pins below, while the four alternating current (AC) pins for neutral and three-phase are removed, while the signal pins of Type 2 remain, compared to IEC Type 2 (right). \nTypical Combined Charging System (Combo 2) vehicle inlet\nCCS Combo 2 at European Tesla Model 3 vehicle inlet\nThe Combined Charging System (CCS) is a charging station standard for plug-in electric vehicles that uses the Combo 1 (CCS1) or Combo 2 (CCS2) connectors, which are extensions of the IEC 62196 Type 1 and Type 2 alternating current (AC) connectors, respectively, each with two additional direct current (DC) contacts to allow high-power fast charging. CCS chargers can provide power to electric vehicle batteries at up to 500\u00a0kW (max.\u00a01000\u00a0V and 500\u00a0A),[1] and in response to demands for even faster charging, 400 kW CCS chargers have been deployed by charging networks and 990 kW CCS chargers have been demonstrated.\nElectric vehicles and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) are considered CCS-capable if they support either AC or DC charging according to the CCS standards. Manufacturers that support CCS include BMW, Daimler, FCA, Jaguar, Groupe PSA, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, MG, Nissan, Polestar, Renault, Rivian, Tesla, Mahindra, Tata Motors and Volkswagen Group,[2][3] as well as Ford and General Motors for their 2024 North American EV models.[4] Chinese automakers such as BYD, Chery and Zeekr also export CCS2 vehicles for their overseas markets.\nThe CCS standard allows AC charging using the Type 1 and Type 2 connector depending on the geographical region and the charging infrastructure available. This charging environment encompasses charging couplers, charging communication, charging stations, the electric vehicle and various functions for the charging process such as load balancing and charge authorization. Competing charging systems for high-power DC charging include CHAdeMO (widely used in Japan, previously used in North America and Europe),[5] GB/T (China),[6] and the North American Charging System developed by Tesla.[7]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nThe revival of interest in electric cars in the 1990s spurred deployment of charging stations.  Initially, these accessed the abundant AC mains electricity using a variety of plugs around the world. From 2003, the standardization in IEC 62196 of higher-current charging connectors brought about various systems: Type 1 was used primarily in North America and Japan, and Type 2 variants elsewhere. For DC charging, the SAE and European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) made a plan in 2011 to add common DC wires to the existing AC connector types such that there would be only one \"global envelope\" that fitted all DC charging stations.[8]\n\nCombo connector for DC charging (using only the signal pins of Type 2) and the Combo inlet on the vehicle (allowing also AC charging)\nElectric car charging with CCS\nThe proposal for a \"Combined Charging System\" (CCS) was published at the 15th International VDI-Congress (Association of German Engineers) on 12 October 2011 in Baden-Baden. CCS defines a single connector pattern on the vehicle side that offers enough space for a Type 1 or Type 2 connector, along with space for a two-pin DC connector allowing charging at up to 200\u00a0amps. Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Porsche and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce CCS in mid-2012.[9][10] In May 2012, ACEA endorsed the standardization of the Combo 2 connector across the European Union.[11] ACEA were joined later that month by the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) and The Union of the Electricity Industry (EURELECTRIC).[12] Also that month, prototype implementations for up to 100\u00a0kW were shown at EVS26 in Los Angeles.[13] DC charging specifications in IEC\u00a062196-3 (2014) give a range up to 125\u00a0A at up to 850\u00a0V.[14]\nThe seven auto makers also agreed in 2011 to use HomePlug GreenPHY as the communication protocol.[15] The prototype for the matching plug was developed by Phoenix Contact with the goal to withstand 10,000 connect cycles.[16] The standardization proposal was sent to the IEC in January 2011.[17] The request to use a PLC[clarification needed] protocol for Vehicle2Grid communication was made in September 2009 in a joint presentation of BMW, Daimler and VW at a California Air Resources Board ZEV Technology Symposium.[18] This competed with the CAN bus proposal from Japan (including CHAdeMO) and China (GB/T 20234.3, a separate DC connector standard), and none of their car manufacturers had signed up to CCS. However, China had been involved in early stages of the development of the extra DC pins.[16]\nVolkswagen built the first public CCS quick-charge station, providing 50\u00a0kW\u00a0DC, in Wolfsburg in June 2013 to test drive the VW E-Up that was to be delivered with a DC rapid charger connector for CCS.[19] Two weeks later, BMW opened its first CCS rapid charge station to support the BMW i3.[20] Since at least the second EV World Summit in June 2013, the CHAdeMO association, Volkswagen and Nissan all advocate multi-standard DC chargers, as the additional cost of a dual-protocol station is only 5%.[21]\nSince 2014, the European Union has required the provision of Type 2 or Combo 2 within the European electric vehicle charging network.\nIn Germany, the Charging Interface Initiative e. V. (CharIN) was founded by car makers and suppliers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Mennekes, Opel, Phoenix Contact, Porsche, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD and Volkswagen) to promote the adoption of CCS. They noted in a press release that most cars could not charge faster than 50\u00a0kW, so that was the first common power output of CCS stations to be built during 2015. The next step was the standardization of stations with 150\u00a0kW output that they showed in October 2015, looking to a future system with 350\u00a0kW output.[22] Volvo joined CharIN in 2016;[23] Tesla in March 2016;[24] Lucid Motors (previously Atieva) June 2016;[25] Faraday Future June 2016; and Toyota in March 2017.[26]\nIn the United States, BMW and VW stated in April 2016 that the East Coast and West Coast corridors had \"complete\" CCS networks.[27] As part of the 2016 settlement of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, VW committed to spend US$2\u00a0billion in the United States over the following 10 years on CCS and other charging infrastructure through subsidiary company Electrify America.[28] In this effort, charging stations would be built with up to 150\u00a0kW at community-based locations and with up to 350\u00a0kW at highway locations. Besides CCS, CHAdeMO charging stations were to be constructed.[29]\nIn November 2016, Ford, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche and BMW announced they would build a 350\u00a0kW (up to 500 A and 920 V) charge network (IONITY) with 400 stations in Europe,[30] at a cost of \u20ac200,000 ($220,000) each.[31] Most electric cars have a battery pack voltage below 400 volts. With a maximum charge current of 500 A, up to 220 kW charging is possible.\n \nEVSE manufacturers offer CCS chargers capable of outputs beyond 350\u00a0kW. The Terra 360[32] from ABB supports up to 360\u00a0kW charging.\nCCS chargers capable of 400\u00a0kW charging include:\n\nThe Axon Easy 400[33] from Ekoenergetyka\nThe HYC400[34][35] from Alpitronic\nThe Troniq High Power[36] from EVBox\nThe Raption 400 HPC[37] from Circontrol\nThe 400\u00a0kW DP + 600\u00a0kW PC[38] from SK Signet\nThe Liquid Cooled Satellite[39][40] from Kempower\nIn October 2019, Repsol deployed 400\u00a0kW CCS chargers near the A-8 motorway at Abanto-Zierbena, Biscay, Spain.[41]\nIn May 2022, EUROLOOP announced 720\u00a0kW charger WILLBERT Amber II S-HUB to be deployed in 2023 across Belgium.[42]\nIn December 2022, Fastned deployed EVBox Troniq High Power 400\u00a0kW chargers in De Watering, The Netherlands, along the A8 near Oostzaan as part of its charging network.[43]\n \nIn April 2023, Nxu demonstrated a battery-backed, 700\u00a0kW CCS charger[44] in Mesa, Arizona.\nIn May 2023, Shell opened a new station[45] with 400\u00a0kW Kempower chargers in Lonelier outside Kristiansand, Norway.\n\nIn June 2023, XC Power opened a station with QiOn Technology at Supercool Mobility Centers, a group of chargers with main power up to 990 kW with non-cooled CCS1 (up to 240 kW), and a charging station with liquid cooling system, up to 990 kW in Puebla City, Mexico. [46]\nIn first half of 2023, both Ford and General Motors announced that they would transition their North American EV lines from CCS1 to the NACS charge connector beginning with the 2025 model year.[4] These company moves to a competing charging standard prompted a response from the Charging Interface Initiative (CharIN) association, which promotes the CCS standard. They pointed out in June 2023 that \"NACS is not a published or recognized standard by any standards body. For any technology to become a standard it has to go through due process in a standards development organization, such as ISO, IEC, and/or SAE.\"[47] A week later, SAE announced that it had standardized the NACS connector.[48]\n\nTechnical design[edit]\nTerminology for charging components[8]\nVersions of the specifications[edit]\nThe Combined Charging System is meant to develop with the needs of the customer. Version 1.0 covered the currently common features of AC and DC charging, and version 2.0 addressed the near to midterm future. The specifications and underlying standards for CCS 1.0 and CCS 2.0 are described for DC charging in Table 1[citation needed] and for AC charging in Table 2.[49]\nThe automotive manufacturers supporting CCS committed themselves to migrate to CCS 2.0 in 2018.[citation needed] Thus it is recommended for charging station manufacturers to also support CCS 2.0 from 2018 onwards.\nThe specifications of CCS 3.0 were not yet precisely defined[as of?]. All features of previous versions shall be preserved to ensure backward compatibility. Potential additional features include:[citation needed]\n\nReverse power transfer\nInductive charging\nWireless charging communication\nBus charging with \"pantograph\" current collector\nCharging communication[edit]\nUnlike the connector and inlet, which depend on the geographical location, the charging communication is the same around the globe. Generally two types of communication can be differentiated.\n\nBasic signaling (BS) is done using a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal which is transferred over the control pilot (CP) contact according to IEC 61851-1. This communication is used for safety-related functions, indicating for example if the connector is plugged in, before contacts are made live (or energized) and if both charging station and electric vehicle are ready for charging. AC charging is possible using the PWM signal only. In this case the charging station uses the duty cycle of the PWM to inform the onboard charger of the maximum available current at the charging station (A pulse width of 5% indicates that HLC shall be used).\nHigh-level communication (HLC) is done by modulating a high-frequency signal over the CP contact (also known as Power Line Communication or PLC) to transfer more complex information, which may be used e.g. for DC charging or for other services such as \"plug and charge\" or load balancing. High-level communication is based on the standard DIN SPEC 70121 and the ISO/IEC 15118-series.\nLoad balancing[edit]\nCCS differentiates between two methods of load balancing.[citation needed]\n\nReactive load balancing allows changing the energy flow from Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) to EV instantaneously to a specific limit.\nScheduled load balancing supports reactive load balancing and additionally a planning of the energy flow from EVSE to EV with e.g. different power limits and cost indicators over time. It may for example be used to optimize energy distribution in a smart grid.\nCharging authorization modes[edit]\nFor charge authorization, generally two approaches are foreseen.[by whom?]\n\nWith \"plug and charge\", the user plugs in their vehicle and an automated authentication and authorization process is started without any further user interaction. Payment is performed automatically.\nWith \"external payment\", the user has to identify with an RFID card at the terminal, or conduct a payment with a payment card, before they can proceed with charging.\nVehicle coupler[edit]\nSee also: SAE J1772 and Type 2 connector\nCCS Combo connectorsCombo 1Combo 2Displayed approximately to scale.\nThe vehicle coupler is composed of the vehicle connector, which is mounted at the end of a flexible cable, and the vehicle inlet, the counterpart of the connector, which is located within the vehicle. The CCS couplers were based on the Type 1 coupler, the North American standard, and Type 2 coupler, the European standard, as described in IEC 62196-2. One of the challenges of the Combined Charging System was to develop a vehicle inlet which is compatible with both the existing AC vehicle connectors and additional DC contacts. For both Type 1 and Type 2 this has been accomplished by extending the inlet with two additional DC contacts below the existing AC and communication contacts. The resulting new configurations are commonly known as Combo 1 and Combo 2.\nFor the DC vehicle connector, the implementation varies slightly between Combo 1 and Combo 2. In the case of Combo 1 the connector is extended by two DC contacts, while the Type 1 portion of the connector remains the same with the AC contacts (L1 & N) being unused. For Combo 2 the AC contacts (L1, L2, L3 & N) are completely removed from the connector and therefore the Type 2 portion of the connector has only three contacts remaining \u2013 two communication contacts and a protective earth. The vehicle inlet may retain AC contacts to allow non-CCS AC charging.\nIn both cases, communication and protective earth functions are covered by the original Type 1 or 2 portion of the connector. The Type 1 and Type 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-2, while the Combo 1 and Combo 2 connectors are described in IEC 62196-3 as Configurations EE and FF.[citation needed]\n\n\nMating table for type 1 and combo 1 coupler\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nCable connector\n\n\nType 1\nCombo 1\n\n\nVehicle inlet\n\nType 1\n\nAC charging,single phase\n\nDoes not mate\n\n\nCombo 1\n\nDC charging\n\n\nMating table for type 2 and combo 2 coupler\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nCable connector\n\n\nType 2\nCombo 2\n\n\nVehicle inlet\n\nType 2\n\nAC charging,single phase or three phase\n\nDoes not mate\n\n\nCombo 2\n\nDC charging\n\n\nHigh-power charging[edit]\nMain article: Megawatt Charging System\nAs vehicle couplers for DC charging according to IEC 62196-3:2014 Ed.1 allow DC charging only with currents up to 200 A, they do not sufficiently cover the needs of the future charging infrastructure. Consequently, a later edition of the standard supports currents of up to 500 A. Such high currents, however, either require large cable cross-sections, leading to heavy and stiff cables, or require cooling if thinner cables are desired. In addition, contact resistance leads to more heat dissipation. To cope with these technical issues, the standard IEC TS 62196-3-1 describes the requirements for high-power DC couplers including thermal sensing, cooling and silver-plating of contacts.[50] CharIN are investigating versions over 2 MW for electric trucks, and equipment is being tested.[51][52]\n\nCompetition for global acceptance[edit]\nThe Combined Charging System is primarily driven by European and North American car manufacturers. Type 1 and Combo 1 chargers are primarily found in North and Central America, Korea and Taiwan, while Type 2 and Combo 2 can be found in Europe, South America, South Africa, Arabia, India, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Oceania and Australia. For DC charging the competing standard GB/T 20234-2015 is used in China, while Japan uses CHAdeMO.\nIn the European Union, according to Directive 2014/94/EU[53] all high-power DC charging points installed after November 18, 2017, were to be equipped for interoperability purposes at least with Combo 2 connectors.[citation needed] However, this does not prohibit the provision of other charging points using e.g. CHAdeMO or AC Rapid.\nUntil 2024,[54] the majority[55] of EVs sold in the United States were made by Tesla and did not natively support CCS charging. Tesla used a proprietary connector from the early-2010s through 2022, though newer Tesla cars also support CCS with a separately sold adapter.[56] In November 2022, Tesla renamed its previously proprietary charging connector to the North American Charging Standard (NACS), making the specifications available to other EV manufacturers and allowing it to support the same signalling standard as CCS.[57][58][59]\nIn 2023, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Rivian announced that they would use NACS instead of CCS connectors on all future North American BEV models. Vehicles will initially come with an adapter in 2024, but new models starting from 2025 would be built with native NACS ports.[60][61][62] Subsequently, other EV companies signed agreements for native NACS adoption, including Aptera, BMW Group, Fisker, Honda, Hyundai Motor Group, Jaguar, Lucid, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Polestar, Subaru, Toyota, and Volvo. Many major charging networks and charging equipment suppliers also announced support for NACS, including EVgo, FLO, ABB E-Mobility, and EverCharge. NACS was subsequently ratified internationally as standard SAE J3400.\nThis has led to predictions that CCS1 will soon be obsolete, as it is bigger, heavier and more expensive than NACS.[63][64][65][66][67]\nHilton Worldwide announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 EVSEs across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025.[68]\nIn many other countries no standard is preferred yet, although CharIN recommended advanced Type 2 and Combo 2 in 2018.[69]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"CCS HPC350 power class-voltage and current range\". 2019-10-01.

The intent is to define a common electric vehicle conductive charging system architecture including operational requirements and the functional and dimensional requirements for the vehicle inlet and mating connector.\nThe J1772 5-pin standard supports a wide range of single-phase (1\u03c6) alternating current (AC) charging rates. They range from portable devices that can connect to a household NEMA 5-15 outlet that can deliver 1.44\u00a0kW (12\u00a0A @ 120\u00a0V) to hardwired equipment that can deliver up to 19.2\u00a0kW (80\u00a0A @ 240\u00a0V).[2] These connectors are sometimes informally referred to as chargers, but they are \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" (EVSE), since they only supply AC power to the vehicle's on-board charger, which then converts it to the direct current (DC) needed to recharge the battery.\nThe Combined Charging System (CCS) Combo 1 connector builds on the standard, adding two additional pins for DC fast charging up to 350\u00a0kW.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nThe older Avcon connector, featured here on a Ford Ranger EV\nThe main stimulus for the development of SAE J1772 came from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Early electric vehicles like the General Motors EV1 and Toyota RAV4 EV used Magne Charge (SAE J1773), an inductive system. CARB rejected the inductive technology in favor of conductive coupling to supply electricity for recharging. In June 2001, CARB adopted the SAE J1772-2001 standard as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California.[3][4] This early version of the connector was made by Avcon and featured a rectangular connector capable of delivering up to 6.6\u00a0kW of electrical power.[5][6] The California regulations mandated the usage of SAE J1772-2001 beginning with the 2006 model year.\nCARB would later ask for higher current delivery than the 6.6\u00a0kW that the 2001 J1772 (Avcon) standard supported. This process led to the proposal of a new round connector design by Yazaki which allowed for an increased power delivery of up to 19.2\u00a0kW delivered via single phase 120\u2013240 V AC at up to 80 amps. In 2008, CARB published a new standard that mandated the usage of the new connector beginning with the 2010 model year;[7] this was approved in 2012.[8]\nThe Yazaki plug that was built to the new SAE J1772 plug standard successfully completed certification at UL. The standard specification was subsequently voted upon by the SAE committee in July 2009.[9] On January 14, 2010, the SAE J1772 REV 2009 was adopted by the SAE Motor Vehicle Council.[10] The companies participating in or supporting the revised 2009 standard include smart, Chrysler, GM,  Ford, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Rivian, and Tesla.\nThe SAE J1772-2009 connector specification was subsequently added to the international IEC 62196-2 standard (\u201cPart 2: Dimensional compatibility and interchangeability requirements for a.c. pin and contact-tube accessories\u201d) with voting on the final specification slated to close in May 2011.[11][needs update] The SAE J1772 connector is considered a \u201cType 1\u201d implementation providing a single phase coupler.[12]\n\nVehicle equipment[edit]\nThe SAE J1772-2009 was adopted by electric vehicle manufacturers in the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf. The connector became standard equipment in the U.S. market due to the availability of charging stations supporting it in the nation's electric vehicle network (helped by funding such as the ChargePoint America program drawing grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act).[13][14]\nThe European versions were equipped with a SAE J1772-2009 inlet as well until the automotive industry settled on the IEC Type 2 \u201cMennekes\u201d connector as the standard inlet\u00a0\u2013 since all IEC connectors use the same SAE J1772 signaling protocol the car manufacturers are selling cars with either a SAE J1772-2009 inlet or an IEC Type 2 inlet depending on the regional market. There are also (passive) adapters available that can convert J1772-2009 to IEC Type 2 and vice versa. The only difference is that most European versions have an on-board charger that can take advantage of three-phase electric power with higher voltage and current limits even for the same basic electric vehicle model (such as the Chevrolet Volt/Opel Ampera).[citation needed]\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS)[edit]\nMain article: Combined Charging System\nCCS Combo 1 vehicle inlet showing the J1772 and the two DC fast-charging pins\nIn 2011, SAE developed a J1772/CCS Combo Coupler variant of the J1772-2009 connector in order to also support the Combined Charging System standard for direct current (DC) fast charging, which includes the standard 5-pin J1772 connector along with an additional two larger pins to support fast DC charging.  Combo 1 accommodates charging at 200\u2013920 volts DC and up to 350\u00a0kW.[1][needs update] The combination coupler will also use power-line communication technology to communicate between the vehicle, off-board charger, and smart grid.[15] Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Porsche, Volvo, and Volkswagen) agreed in late 2011 to introduce the Combined Charging System in mid-2012.[16] The first vehicles using the SAE Combo plug were the BMW i3 released in late 2013, and the Chevrolet Spark EV released in 2014.[17]\nIn Europe, the combo coupler is based on the Type 2 (VDE) AC charging connector (Combo 2) maintaining full compatibility with the SAE specification for DC charging and the HomePlug Green PHY PLC protocol.[18] In 2019 Tesla introduced the Model 3 with a CCS Combo 2 plug in Europe, but has not introduced models with CCS in the US. With the introduction of the Model 3 in Europe, Tesla added CCS charging cables to V2 Superchargers (supporting both CCS Combo 2 and Tesla DC Type 2). European V3 Tesla Superchargers include only a CCS charging cable.[19]\n\nProperties[edit]\nConnector[edit]\nThe J1772-2009 connector is designed for single phase alternating current electrical systems with 120\u00a0V or 240\u00a0V such as those used in North America and Japan. The round 43-millimetre (1.7\u00a0in) diameter connector is keyed and has five pins (viewed from outside of the plug):[20]\n\n\nSAE J1772 / IEC 62196-2-1 Type 1\n\n\n\n\nRow\nPosition\nFunction\nNotes\n\n\nTop[a]\n\n1\n\nL1\n\n\"AC Line 1\"\n\n\n2\n\nN\n\n\"AC Neutral\" for 120\u00a0V Level 1 charging or \"AC Line 2\" for 208\u2013240\u00a0V Level 2 charging\n\n\nBottom[b]\n\n3\n\nPE\n\n\"Protective Earth\" aka Ground\n\n\nMiddle[c]\n\n4\n\nPP\n\n\"Proximity Pilot\" aka \"plug present\", which provides a signal to the vehicle's control system so it can prevent movement while connected to the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE; i.e., the charging station), and signals the latch release button to the vehicle.[citation needed]\n\n\n5\n\nCP\n\n\"Control Pilot\" is a communication line used to negotiate charging level between the car and the EVSE, and it can be manipulated by the vehicle to initiate charging and can carry other information.[21] The signal is a 1\u00a0kHz square wave at \u00b112 volts generated by the EVSE to detect the presence of the vehicle, communicate the maximum allowable charging current, and control charging begin/end.[22]\n\n\n\n^ Top row is spaced 6.8\u00a0mm (0.27\u00a0in) above the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 15.7\u00a0mm (0.62\u00a0in) apart about the centerline.\n\n^ Bottom row is spaced 10.6\u00a0mm (0.42\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector.\n\n^ Middle row is spaced 5.6\u00a0mm (0.22\u00a0in) below the centerline of the connector and the pins are spaced 21.3\u00a0mm (0.84\u00a0in) apart about the centerline.\n\n\nThe connector is designed to withstand 10,000 mating cycles (a connection and a disconnection) and exposure to the elements. With 1 mating cycle per day, the connector's lifespan should exceed 27 years.[23]\n\nRelease mechanism[edit]\n\n\n\nBlack release button on an SAE J1772 plug in a mockup car\n\n\n\nSAE J1772 plugs operated by thumb at a VinFast charging station\n\n\n\nAdaptor cable from Nissan with Type 1 plug for the car, Type 2 plug for a European charger socket\n\n\n\nIEC 62196 Type 2 connector with openings on the side for automatic release\n\n\nThe SAE J1772 or Type 1 plug is locked into the car with a hook that is manually operated, mostly by pressing a button with the thumb, which interrupts power. This allows anybody to stop charging and even theft of the cable. To prevent this, the European IEC 62196 Type 2 connector has openings on the side for automatic locking and release, operated by the car owner via remote control. If the car locks or releases its plug, the charger will follow suit according to the PP signal.\nIn addition, the charge port on many modern cars with a J1772 connector have an extendable pin that blocks the J1772 latch from being raised. By extending this pin, it becomes impossible to raise the release latch. In this way, the vehicle can prevent a plugged-in J1772 connector from being removed. This is essential for the CCS implementation where the connector is not designed to break the heavy DC charging current.\n\nCharging[edit]\nThe SAE J1772-2017 standard defines four levels of charging: AC Level 1, AC Level 2, DC Level 1, and DC Level 2.[24]  Earlier released revisions of J1772 also listed a never-implemented AC Level 3, which was considered but never implemented.\n\n\n\nCharge method\n\nVoltage (V)\n\nPhase\n\nMax. current, continuous (A)\n\nBranch circuit breaker rating (A)[a]\n\nMax. power (kW)\n\n\nAC Level 1\n\n120\n\n1\n\n12\n\n15\n\n1.44\n\n\n16\n\n20\n\n1.92\n\n\nAC Level 2\n\n208 or 240\n\n1\n\n24\u201380\n\n30\u2013100\n\n5.0\u201319.2\n\n\nAC Level 3[b]\n\n208\u2013600\n\n3\n\n63\u2013160\n\n80-200\n\n22.7\u2013166\n\n\nCharge method\n\nVoltage (V)\n\nPhase\n\nMax. current (A)\n\nMax. power (kW)\n\n\nDC Level 1\n\n50\u20131000\n\n\u2013\n\n80\n\n80\n\n\nDC Level 2\n\n50\u20131000\n\n\u2013\n\n400\n\n400\n\n\n\n^ Per NEC article 625.41, branch circuit rating must be at least 125% of EVSE maximum continuous current\n\n^ As noted in Appendix M of the SAE J1772 standard document, a third AC charge method was considered but never implemented for light vehicles. For heavy and industrial vehicles, this was left to the SAE J3068 Medium and Heavy Duty Vehicle Conductive Charging Task Force Committee which permits the J1772 protocol at 400 VAC or less and requires a newer LIN protocol above 400 VAC (LIN is recommended at all voltages).  J3068 uses the Type 2 (Mennekes connector) possibly supplying up to 166\u00a0kW.[25]  The J1772 AC Level 3 mode using single phase power would have provided up to 96\u00a0kW at a nominal voltage of 240 V AC and a maximum current of 400 A.  This power level is closer to what J3068 implemented a decade later at up to 600 VAC, although J3068 version 1 only supports up to 250 amps.\n\n\nFor example, the 2020 Chevrolet Bolt has a 66-kWh lithium-ion battery and a 7.2-kW onboard charging module; with an EPA range of 259 miles (417\u00a0km) and energy efficiency of 118\u00a0mpg\u2011e (29\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0mi; 17.7\u00a0kW\u22c5h/100\u00a0km),[26] it can use its portable charge cord to charge at AC Level 1 (120\u00a0V, 12\u00a0A) to get up to 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) of range per hour or go off an AC Level 2 charging unit (240\u00a0V, 32\u00a0A) to get up to 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) of range per hour. Using an optional DC fast charging (DCFC) port, this model can also charge at up to 55\u00a0kW to get up to 180\u00a0mi (290\u00a0km) of range per hour.\nOther EVs utilizing an 800\u00a0V battery architecture (such as those on Hyundai's E-GMP platform) can charge much faster. According to Hyundai, \"With a 350 kW DC charger, IONIQ 5 can charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. According to WLTP cycle, IONIQ 5 users only need to charge the vehicle for five minutes to get 100 km of range.\"[27] These vehicles are capable of accepting up to 230kW until about 50% State of charge, allowing these vehicles to recharge much quicker than similar EVs with lower voltage batteries.\nSome EVs have extended J1772 to allow AC Level 1 (120\u00a0V) charging at greater than 16 amps. This is useful, for example, at RV parks where TT-30 (\"Travel Trailer\" - 120\u00a0V, 30\u00a0A) receptacles are common. These allow charging at up to 24 amps. However, this level of 120\u00a0V charging has not been codified into J1772.\nAnother extension, supported by the North American Charging System, is Level 2 charging at 277\u00a0V.  Like 208\u00a0V, 277\u00a0V is commonly found in North American commercial three-phase circuits.\n\nSafety[edit]\nThe J1772 standard includes several levels of shock protection, ensuring the safety of charging even in wet conditions.  Physically, the connection pins are isolated on the interior of the connector when mated, ensuring no physical access to those pins.  When not mated, J1772 connectors have no power at the pins;[28] they are not energized until commanded by the vehicle.[29]\nThe proximity detection pin is connected to a switch in the connector release button. Pressing the release button causes the vehicle to stop drawing current. As the connector is removed, the shorter control pilot pin disconnects first, causing the EVSE to drop power to the plug. This also ensures that the power pins will not be disconnected under load, causing arcs and shortening their life. The ground pin is longer than the other pins, so it breaks last.\n\nSignaling[edit]\nJ1772 signaling circuit\nThe signaling protocol has been designed for the following charging sequence.[29]\n\nsupply equipment signals presence of AC input power\nvehicle detects plug via proximity circuit (thus the vehicle can prevent driving away while connected) and can detect when latch is pressed in preparation for plug removal.\nControl Pilot (CP) functions begin\nsupply equipment detects plug-in electric vehicle (PEV)\nsupply equipment indicates to PEV readiness to supply current\nPEV ventilation requirements are determined\nsupply equipment current capacity provided to PEV\nPEV commands energy flow\nPEV and supply equipment continuously monitor continuity of safety ground\ncharge continues as determined by PEV\ncharge may be interrupted by disconnecting the plug from the vehicle\nThe technical specification was described first in the 2001 version of SAE J1772 and subsequently the IEC 61851-1 and IEC TS 62763:2013. The charging station puts 12\u00a0V on the Control Pilot (CP) and the Proximity Pilot (AKA Plug Present: PP) measuring the voltage differences. This protocol does not require integrated circuits, which would be required for other charging protocols, making the SAE J1772 robust and operable through a temperature range of \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to +85\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\nControl Pilot[edit]\nControl Pilot (Mode): The charging station sends a 1\u00a0kHz square wave on the control pilot that is connected back to the protective earth on the vehicle side by means of a resistor and a diode (voltage range \u00b112.0\u00b10.4\u00a0V). The live wires of public charging stations are always dead if the CP\u2013PE (Protective Earth) circuit is open, although the standard allows a charging current as in Mode 1 (maximum 16\u00a0A). If the circuit is closed, the charging station can also verify that the protective earth is functional. The vehicle can request a certain charging function by setting the resistance between the CP and PE pins; 2.7\u00a0k\u03a9 announces a Mode 3 compatible vehicle (vehicle detected) which does not require charging. 880\u00a0\u03a9 says the vehicle is ready to be charged, and 240\u00a0\u03a9 requests with ventilation charging, in which case the charging stations supplies charging power only if the area is ventilated (i.e., outdoors).\nThe Control Pilot line circuitry examples in SAE J1772:2001 show that the current loop CP\u2013PE is connected permanently on the vehicle side via a 2.74\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor, making for a voltage drop from +12\u00a0V to +9\u00a0V when a cable is hooked up to the charging station, which activates the wave generator. The charging is activated by the vehicle by adding parallel 1.3\u00a0k\u03a9 resistor resulting in a voltage drop to +6\u00a0V or by adding a parallel 270\u00a0\u03a9 resistor for a required ventilation resulting in a voltage drop to +3\u00a0V. Hence the charging station can react by only checking the voltage range present on the CP\u2013PE loop.[30] Note that the diode will only make for a voltage drop in the positive range; any negative voltage on the CP\u2013PE loop is blocked by D1 in the vehicle, any significant current that does flow in the CP\u2013PE loop during the negative period will shut off the current as being considered a fatal error (like touching the pins).\nFor IEC62196-2 male plugs the Control Pilot pin is made shorter to prevent untethered cables being used as \"extension leads\", This prevents the use of downstream cables that may have a lower current capability being connected to a cable of a higher current rating.\n\n\n\nBase status\n\nCharging status\n\nResistance, CP\u2013PE\n\nResistance, R2\n\nVoltage, CP\u2013PE\n\n\nStatus A\n\nStandby\n\nOpen, or \u221e\u00a0\u03a9\n\n\n\n+12\u00a0V\n\n\nStatus B\n\nVehicle detected\n\n2740\u00a0\u03a9\n\n\n\n+9\u00b11\u00a0V\n\n\nStatus C\n\nReady (charging)\n\n882\u00a0\u03a9\n\n1300\u00a0\u03a9\n\n+6\u00b11\u00a0V\n\n\nStatus D\n\nWith ventilation\n\n246\u00a0\u03a9\n\n270\u00a0\u03a9\n\n+3\u00b11\u00a0V\n\n\nStatus E\n\nNo power (shut off)\n\n\n\n\n\n0\u00a0V\n\n\nStatus F\n\nError\n\n\n\n\n\n-12\u00a0V\n\nControl Pilot (Current limit): The charging station can use the wave signal to describe the maximum current that is available via the charging station with the help of pulse-width modulation: a 16% PWM is a 10\u00a0A maximum, a 25% PWM is a 16\u00a0A maximum, a 50% PWM is a 32\u00a0A maximum and a 90% PWM flags a fast charge option.[31]\nThe PWM duty cycle of the 1\u00a0kHz CP signal indicates the maximum allowed mains current. According to the SAE it includes socket outlet, cable and vehicle inlet. In the US, the definition of the ampacity (ampere capacity, or current capacity) is split for continuous and short term operation.[31] The SAE defines the ampacity value to be derived by a formula based on the 1\u00a0ms full cycle (of the 1\u00a0kHz signal) with the maximum continuous ampere rating being 0.6\u00a0A per 10\u00a0\u03bcs up to 850\u00a0\u03bcs (with the lowest (100\u00a0\u03bcs/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 0.6\u00a0A = 6\u00a0A).  Above 850\u00a0\u03bcs, the formula requires subtraction of 640\u00a0\u03bcs and multiplying the difference by 2.5.  For example ((960\u00a0\u03bcs \u2212 640\u00a0\u03bcs)/10\u00a0\u03bcs) \u00d7 2.5\u00a0A = 80\u00a0A.[30]\n\n\nPWM duty cycle indicating ampere capacity[31]\n\n\nPWM\n\nSAE continuous\n\nSAE short term\n\n\n50%\n\n30 A\n\n36 A peak\n\n\n40%\n\n24 A\n\n30 A peak\n\n\n30%\n\n18 A\n\n22 A peak\n\n\n25%\n\n15 A\n\n20 A peak\n\n\n16%\n\n9.6 A\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n6 A\n\n\n\nProximity Pilot[edit]\nThe proximity pin, PP (also known as plug present), as shown in the SAE J1772 example pinout, describes the switch, S3, as being mechanically linked to the connector latch release actuator. During charging, the EVSE side connects the PP\u2013PE loop via S3 and a 150\u00a0\u03a9 R6; when opening the release actuator a 330\u00a0\u03a9 R7 is added in the PP\u2013PE loop on the EVSE side which gives a voltage shift on the line to allow the electric vehicle to initiate a controlled shut off prior to actual disconnection of the charge power pins. However, many low-power adapter cables do not offer that locking actuator state detection on the PP pin.\nUnder IEC 62196 the Proximity Pin is also used to indicate the cable capacity \u2013 this is relevant for non-tethered EVSEs.\nThe resistor is coded to the maximum current capability of the cable assembly. The EV interrupts the current supply if the current capability of the cable is exceeded as detected by the measurement of the Rc (shown as R6 in the J1772 signaling circuit above), as defined by the values for the recommended interpretation range.\nRc is placed between the PP and PE, within the detachable cable assembly.\n\n\n\nCurrent capability of the cable assembly\n\nRc (\u00b13%)\n\nRecommended interpretation range by the EVSE\n\n\n13 A\n1.5 k\u03a9 / 0.5 W\n1\u20132.7\u00a0k\u03a9\n\n\n20 A\n680 \u03a9 / 0.5 W\n330 \u03a9 \u2013 1 k\u03a9\n\n\n32 A\n220 \u03a9 / 1 W\n150\u2013330\u00a0\u03a9\n\n\n70 A single-phase / 63 A three-phase\n100 \u03a9 / 1 W\n50\u2013150\u00a0\u03a9\n\n[32]\n\nP1901 powerline communication[edit]\nIn an updated standard due in 2012, SAE proposes to use power line communication, specifically IEEE 1901, between the vehicle, off-board charging station, and the smart grid, without requiring an additional pin; SAE and the IEEE Standards Association are sharing their draft standards related to the smart grid and vehicle electrification.[33]\nP1901 communication is compatible with other 802.x standards via the IEEE 1905 standard, allowing arbitrary IP-based communications with the vehicle, meter or distributor, and the building where chargers are located.  P1905 includes wireless communications. In at least one implementation, communication between the off-board DC EVSE and PEV occurs on the pilot wire of the SAE J1772 connector via HomePlug Green PHY power line communication (PLC).[34][35][36]\n\nCompeting standards[edit]\nA competing proposal known as the Mennekes connector initiated by RWE and Daimler was standardized in 2011's IEC 62196 as its Type 2 connector. It has been widely adopted as the European Union's standard single- and three-phase coupler.[12][37] The connector adopted the same protocols for the pilot pin as J1772's J-Plug. The IEC specification allows for up to 63\u00a0A and 43.6\u00a0kW.  In 2018, the SAE J3068 committee released an enhancement to the EU connector tailored for the North American industrial market allowing up to 160\u00a0A / 166\u00a0kW on 3\u03c6 power.\nThe same IEC\u00a062196-2 standard also specified a pair of Type 3 connector from Scame Global providing a single- and three-phase coupler with shutters.[12]  After a 2016 approval by the IEC for a small modification to the Mennekes connector optionally allowing shutters, Type 3 has been deprecated.\nTokyo Electric Power Company has developed a specification solely for automotive high-voltage DC fast charging using the JARI DC connector and formed the CHAdeMO (charge de move, equivalent to \"charge for moving\") association with Japanese automakers Mitsubishi, Nissan and Subaru to promote it.[38]\n\nSee also[edit]\nSAE J3068 \u2014 Electric Vehicle Power Transfer System Using a Three-Phase Capable Coupler\nNorth American Charging System\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ SAE International (2017-10-13). \"SAE Electric Vehicle and Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler J1772_201710\" (DOC).

As of July\u00a02025[update], Tesla operates a network of about 7,500 Supercharger stations with over 70,000 connectors worldwide. The majority are located in three regions: Asia Pacific (3,000 stations), North America (3,000), and Europe (1,500). Superchargers can currently output as much as 325\u00a0kilowatts\u00a0(kW), with plans to increase output capacity to 500 kW in the future.\nUsage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. To discourage loitering, fees may be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed.\n\n\nTechnology[edit]\nOne of the earliest supercharger stations in the United States, located in Lebec, California, has a solar canopy from Tesla Energy.\nTesla typically places Superchargers near major highways at locations with amenities for drivers, such as restrooms, restaurants, and shopping.[1] Some sites also have solar canopies and Megapacks[2] installed by Tesla Energy to offset energy use and provide drivers with protection from the elements.[3]\n\nWhen both pairs of this V1 Tesla Supercharger station stalls (A and B) are occupied, they share the available power of up to 120\u00a0kW combined.\nThe original V1 and V2 Tesla supercharging stations were built with a single charger equipment cabinet consisting of four modules shared between two charge posts. When cars are connected to the two posts, and both request maximum power, the station will assign two or three of the four modules to the car plugged in first, and the rest to the later car, limiting the charging output to each car to  50%-50% or 75%-25%.[4]\nAs an alternative to the Supercharger, in 2015, Tesla briefly implemented a battery swapping station at Harris Ranch in California. The Tesla battery station performed a few swaps and was discontinued shortly afterwards.[5]\n\"Urban\" Supercharger posts were introduced in September 2017. These more compact posts have a maximum power delivery of 72\u00a0kW but do not share equipment with other posts, allowing the maximum power to be delivered. These more compact posts are primarily deployed in urban areas such as shopping malls, parking lots, and garages.[6][7]\nV3 stations were introduced in 2019 and could deliver up to 250\u00a0kW. Up to four posts can share a 350\u00a0kW charger equipment cabinet, but up to three cabinets can share power among themselves via a DC bus. In practice, in most cases, this allows each post to deliver maximum power regardless of nearby charging sessions.[8] The V3 charge posts use a liquid-cooled cable which allows the cable to be thinner and lighter while delivering more power.[9][10]\nTesla introduced mobile Supercharger stations in 2019 with several urban supercharger posts and a Tesla Megapack energy storage system mounted on a semi-trailer truck. These stations provide temporary stations for nearby events, expand capacity during peak travel seasons, or can be deployed when a station needs to be taken offline. The Megapack can charge up to 100 vehicles before being depleted.[11]\nV4 charging posts began to roll out in early 2023 and have longer cables for charging vehicles from other automakers.[12] The charging posts have a credit card reader potentially allowing non-Tesla owners to charge without downloading the Tesla app, however, as of January 2024[update] this feature has not been implemented.[13] The charging posts can support up to 1000\u00a0volts and up to 1000\u00a0amps\u00a0(A).[14][15] As of January 2025, they can deliver up to 325\u00a0kW.[16] The company plans to increase power delivery to 500\u00a0kW in the future.[17]\nOn November 14, 2024, Tesla announced the introduction of the V4 Supercharger cabinet, which will start in 2025.\u00a0This version can support charging vehicles with 400 and 800\u00a0V systems and delivering as much as 1.2\u00a0MW.[18]\nAccording to Tesla, in July 2025 the Oto\u010dac Supercharger in Croatia became the first European Supercharger station to be supported by a mobile Megapack.[19]\n\n\n\nVersion\nImage\nMax power\nFeatures / Notes\n\n\nV1\n\n\n\n90 or 120\u00a0kW\n\n\nPower output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger.\n\n\n\nV2\n\n\n\n120 or 150\u00a0kW\n\n\nPower output reduced when another vehicle is plugged into the paired, typically neighboring, charger.\n\n\n\nUrban\n\n\n\n72\u00a0kW\n\n\nSmaller form factor, lower power device for urban installations.\n\n\n\nV3\n\n\n\n250\u00a0kW\n\n\nEquipped with a thinner, lighter cable that uses liquid cooling.\nSome North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles.\n\n\n\nV4\n\n\n\n325\u00a0kW\n\n\nEquipped with a longer cable for charging non-Tesla vehicles.\nSome North American sites equipped with \"Magic Dock\" CCS adapter for charging non-Tesla vehicles.\n\n\nConnectors and interoperability[edit]\nConnector standards used by Superchargers worldwide:\u00a0\u00a0NACS\u00a0\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0CCS2\u00a0\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0GB/T \nNorth America[edit]\nIn February 2023, Tesla began installing the \"Magic Dock\" at select V3 Supercharger locations.[20] This dock houses a NACS (North American Charging System) to CCS1 (Combined Charging System) adapter. When a driver of a NACS-equipped vehicle charges, they simply detach the NACS connector, leaving the adapter locked in place on the charging post. However, when a CCS-equipped vehicle driver reserves a charger via the Tesla mobile app, the Magic Dock unlocks the adapter, making it available for use. The \"magic\" lies in the adapter's captive design\u2014it remains securely locked either in the dock (when a NACS vehicle is charging) or onto the NACS connector (when a CCS vehicle is charging).[21]\nTesla began rolling out V4 Supercharger posts in North America in October 2023, featuring an integrated Magic Dock and a built-in payment terminal.[22][23][24]  These upgrades allowed non-Tesla vehicles to charge without requiring a separate adapter or the Tesla app, and making Tesla eligible for federal, state, and local incentives. This included $7.5\u00a0billion in funding under the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to support the expansion of charging infrastructure.[25]\nHowever, between May 2023 and February 2024, most North American automakers committed to adopting NACS. In September 2024, SAE finalized the standardization of NACS as SAE J3400, effectively eliminating the need for future Tesla Superchargers to support CCS1. As a result, fewer than 100 V3 sites were upgraded with the Magic Dock, and fewer than 50 V4 sites had their Magic Dock adapter activated as of February 2025.[26] Additionally, only two V4 locations globally, both located outside of North America, currently support the use of the payment terminal.[27]\n\nEurope[edit]\nEuropean V2 charger with dual cables, a Type 2 connector and (plugged in) CCS2\nIn November 2018, under pressure from European regulators, Tesla announced that it would begin using the CCS2 charging standard, adding the inlets to new vehicles, offering adapters to existing vehicle owners and adding CCS2 connectors to Superchargers.[28][29][30]\n\nChina[edit]\nIn China, Tesla equips its vehicles and Superchargers with the GB/T charging standard (an abbreviation of \"GuoBiao/TuiJian\", translated as \"recommended national standard\").[31]\n\nNetwork[edit]\nThe average number of Tesla cars per Supercharger stall was 34 in 2016.[32][33] As of September 2023, Tesla bids building its chargers at about half the cost of its competitors.[34] Cost estimates per station range from US$100,000 in 2013[35] to US$270,000 in 2015, depending on the number of stalls and other circumstances.[36] In a 2014 filing with the SEC, Tesla reported an \"estimated useful life of 12 years\".[37]\nMost car charging occurs at home or work, a situation that Tesla has compared to cell phone charging.[38] As of 2014[update], less than 10% of charging came from Superchargers.[39]\nFor 2021, Tesla states the network had 99.96% uptime (at least 50% daily capacity) and its power was 100% renewable (through solar power on-site and through purchasing electricity which was matched to renewable generation.)[40][41][42]\nIn May 2024, it was reported that Tesla had laid off its entire Supercharger team, including its head, Rebecca Tinucci.[43] Tinucci had made an initial staffing cut of 15\u201320% two weeks prior, as part of company-wide layoffs; after a meeting with Musk in which she proposed a massive network expansion, he demanded more layoffs. When she resisted, stating that further cuts would affect the fundamental business, he dismissed the entire team.[44] The move was widely expected to slow deployment of stations in the short- to medium-term.[45] Executives at charging companies have begun to prepare for Tesla to pull out of the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, announced in 2023 with a goal to add 500,000 charging ports over the next five years. Tesla had been awarded contracts to build chargers at 69 of the 501 sites that had received funding to-date.[46] 10 days later, Musk promised to invest US$500M to expand the network this year,[47] which would be \"a significant reduction\" from the original plans for 2024, according to former Tesla employees, resulting in an estimated 77% reduction in the rate of charging port deployment. The responsibilities for Supercharger construction and contract management have been taken over by Tesla's energy team.[44]\n\nBilling[edit]\nUsage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. Idle fees can be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed to discourage loitering and, beginning in 2023, some sites have begun to introduce congestion charges to discourage charging at high states of charge when charging is generally slower.[48] All charges accrued during supercharging are billed to the Tesla account the car is associated with or to the credit card on file for that account.[49]\nUnlimited free supercharging for life was offered as a promotion for Model S and Model X cars ordered prior to January 15, 2017,[50] and between August 2, 2019[51] and May 26, 2020.[52] Unlimited supercharging was also offered during specific periods for vehicles purchased with referral codes.[53]\nAdditionally, Model S and Model X cars that were ordered between January 15, 2017, and November 2, 2018, received 400 kWh (about 1,000 miles or 1,600\u00a0km) of free Supercharging credits per year.[49] After the credits are exhausted, supercharging is billed at normal price.[54]\n\nDeployment[edit]\nAs of January\u00a02025[update], Tesla operates a network of 7,000 Supercharger stations with over 65,800 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,800 stations), North America (over 2,800), and Europe (over 1,300).[26]\n\n\n\nTesla global Supercharger count\n\n\nYear\nStations\nAnnualgrowth\nConnectors\nAnnualgrowth\nSource\n\n\n2012\n7\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n[26]\n\n\n2013\n63\n800%\n\u2014\n\u2014\n[26]\n\n\n2014\n380\n503%\n\u2014\n\u2014\n[55]\n\n\n2015\n584\n54%\n\u2014\n\u2014\n[56]\n\n\n2016\n790\n35%\n\u2014\n\u2014\n[57]\n\n\n2017\n1,128\n43%\n\u2014\n\u2014\n[58]\n\n\n2018\n1,421\n26%\n12,002\n\u2014\n[59]\n\n\n2019\n1,821\n28%\n16,104\n34%\n[60]\n\n\n2020\n2,564\n41%\n23,277\n45%\n[61]\n\n\n2021\n3,476\n36%\n31,498\n35%\n[62]\n\n\n2022\n4,678\n35%\n42,419\n35%\n[63]\n\n\n2023\n\n5,952\n\n27%\n\n54,892\n\n29%\n\n[64]\n\n\n2024\n\n6,975\n\n17%\n\n65,495\n\n19%\n\n[1]\n\nNorth America[edit]\nTesla Model S charging at a Supercharger V1 stall in Newark, Delaware\n50,000th Supercharger stall in Roseville, California, with a commemorative plaque and in Ultra Red color\nThe first Superchargers in the world opened in 2012 in the United States, with the company initially focusing on high-traffic corridors. The first five stations enabled travel between Los Angeles, San Francisco, Lake Tahoe in California and Las Vegas, Nevada.[65][66] Soon after, two stations were installed along Interstate 95 in Connecticut and Delaware, enabling trips between Boston, New York and Washington, DC.[67][68][69] By mid-July 2013, 15 stations were open across the United States.[70]  In October 2013, Tesla announced that the entire West Coast was opened along Interstate 5 and US Route 101.[71][72] In January 2014, the first coast-to-coast corridor was completed: from Los Angeles to Chicago via South Dakota, then to New York City.[73]\nSupercharging stations were available in Canada along Ontario Highway 401 and Quebec Autoroute 20 corridor between Toronto and Montreal by 2014.[74]\nAs of January\u00a02025[update], the United States (including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico) has over 2,500 Supercharging sites with nearly 30,000 stalls, more than any other nation in the world. Canada has 236 sites and Mexico has 35.[26] Some stations have many stalls - the Barstow site has 120 stalls, Harris Ranch has 98 stalls, and the Lost Hills, California site has 84 stalls on a relatively small 1.5 MW grid connection with 11 MW onsite solar and 39 MWh battery.[75]\n\nSouth America[edit]\nIn October 2024, Tesla opened its first South American Superchargers in Chile.[76] As of January\u00a02025[update], the country has two Supercharging sites.[26]\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa[edit]\nTesla Supercharger station at a Bundesautobahn 9 rest stop near M\u00fcnchberg, Germany\nIn early 2015, the first European Supercharger was upgraded with a 'solar canopy' (a carport with solar cells on the roof) in K\u00f8ge, Denmark.[77] According to Tesla the Supercharger had 300\u00a0m2 (3,230\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of solar cells with a projected annual production of 40\u00a0MWh and is, as of 2018, equipped with its own battery bank for temporary storage of excess production.[78] In April 2016, Kostom\u0142oty became the first charger to open in Poland.[79] Tesla opened a grid-connected 2-stall Supercharger at N\u00fcrburgring in 2019.[80] There are a few privately operated Supercharger stations such as the one opened on April 27, 2016, in Zarechye, Russia, with 3 stalls.[81]\nIn 2015, the European Supercharger network was planned to allow a Model S to drive from the North Cape (near Honningsv\u00e5g) in Norway to Istanbul, Turkey or Lisbon, Portugal.[78] As of August 2023[update], there are Supercharger stations in or near both Istanbul[82] and Lisbon.[83] The map of current and planned sites[84] includes every European Union country except Malta and Cyprus, and represents all of the countries in the world in the top 10 of electric vehicle adoption rates.[85]\nTesla started testing the charging of non-Tesla cars in the Netherlands in 2021[86] and in Norway in early 2022 on 15 large un-congested stations with CCS2.[87] Tesla opened new stations for non-Tesla cars in several countries in 2022, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.[88]\nIn the Middle East, Israel, Jordan, Qatar[89] and the United Arab Emirates have sites. The only nation in Africa to have Supercharger sites is Morocco.[26]\nAs of July\u00a02024[update], the European region has more than 1,350 Supercharging sites across more than 20 countries.[26]\n\nAsia Pacific[edit]\nChina is the second largest market for Superchargers after the United States. Tesla operates nearly 2,200 sites in the country with over 12,350 stalls as of January\u00a02025[update]. Superchargers are also available in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.[26]\nAs of January\u00a02025[update], other countries with Superchargers include South Korea with 166 sites, Japan with 125, Australia with 108, Taiwan with 107, New Zealand with 28, Thailand with 27, Malaysia with 13, Singapore with 11, Kazakhstan with 2 and the Philippines with 1.[26]\n\nMegacharger[edit]\nSee also: Megawatt Charging System\nIn November 2017, Tesla announced a higher-capacity Megacharger as part of the unveiling of a prototype for its Tesla Semi, a semi-trailer truck. These Megachargers provide 400 miles (644\u00a0km) of charge in 30 minutes to the Tesla Semis.[90][91]\nIn November 2021, the first Megacharger was installed at the Gigafactory Nevada where the Tesla Semi is built.[92] A second Megacharger was permitted for construction at a PepsiCo facility in Modesto, California, in late 2021.[93]\nIn November 2024, Tesla announced that the new V4 cabinets will have support for charging Tesla semis at up to 1.2MW with a Megacharger.[94]\nThe megawatt-class cable for the Megacharger supports three times the current density of the V3 Supercharger\u201435 amperes/mm2 versus approximately 12 for the V3. The cable is also liquid-cooled to support 1000-amp charge rates at 1000 volts in the future.[95]\n\nSee also[edit]\nCharging station\nElectric vehicle charging network\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Major presence in the Asia Pacific, North America, and Europe regions. Morocco and Chile are the only countries with Superchargers in Africa and South America, respectively.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Reynolds, Kim (September 25, 2012). \"Tesla Supercharger: An In-Depth Look\".
